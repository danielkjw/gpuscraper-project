Asus ROG Strix 2080ti (3day initial impressions),rating rating-5,2020-05-01,5/1/2020 2:36:25 PM,"Pros: premium quality feel
temps ( performance toggle) are pretty great actually even time spy it didn't heat up beyond reason.
metal backplate and inner support bar construction help with sag
its a gaming monster!
new fan design the fans are not as straight as with the 1080ti strix the new design directs air down into the card better.Cons: box was barren I mean yea its all about the card but a case badge, some stickers, heck msi gives a entire support bracket ( yea not needed due to inner support) but sill for a flagship product unboxing was a let down.
power indicator lights its a tiny gripe but the two white lights on the power cables wish I could toggle them yea its a neat troubleshooting feature but maybe after startup you could put them asleep in gpu tweek.Overall Review: overall you want the best go with asus rog strix",1stplayerz P.
A beast!,rating rating-5,2020-04-28,4/28/2020 11:57:15 AM,Pros: Runs anything I will ever play! Overclockable.Cons: Havnt found any other than Asus’s Tweak software. MSI afterburner for sure. Overpriced for sure!Overall Review: Great 2080ti! Like all the other overpriced 2080ti’s,James M.
"Expensive, but effective",rating rating-5,2020-03-15,3/15/2020 1:47:16 PM,"Pros: Phenomenal performance, low temperatures, easy installationCons: Huge. Like so huge it might be messing with the airflow in my case. And you should have a plan for GPU sag related issues.

Also, mediocre performance/cost.Overall Review: Makes pretty pictures, at high cost.",Zachary S.

- Able to run oculus rift S smoothly
- Freaking large, good to stare
- almost silent
- g sync made my games look awesomeCons: - 2x8 pin used, might want to double check on your psu first
- the cd came with it are mostly outdated drivers, best to download them yourself
- pricy, but worth itOverall Review: Yes, I build a full RoG themed desktop and this card stand out the most because of its awesomeness. Able to easily OC with its program. Pretty impressed with it.",YEONG D.
"Do not purchase, not worth the money",rating rating-1,2019-12-06,12/6/2019 12:16:50 PM,Pros: None.Cons: Does not OC very well.Overall Review: Terrible OC not worth the money plenty of other manufacturers to buy from.

SMOKING FAST CARD!!!!,rating rating-5,2019-12-02,12/2/2019 7:55:46 AM,"Pros: - Runs at 1980 MHz out of the box without overclocking
- Runs cold, 65C running at 98%Cons: - It ain't cheap.Overall Review: I was running 2 980 Ti's in SLI and this card is faster. No brainier.
Visuals are beautiful in Breakpoint, BattleField V and Black Ops 4.

quality controlOverall Review: This card was ""artifacting"" out of the box, as soon as i loaded into windows I noticed that letters in words such as SETTINGS were not being displayed (EX: S TTI GS). Day 1 I loaded up Raindow 6 Siege and noticed odd visuals on the main menu but that those did not carry over to the actual game so i didn't care too much. The reason i'm sending the card back now after 2 weeks of owning was because NOW BL3, BF4 and R6S do not start and crash before hitting the main menu, Dota 2 has really bad ""Artifacting"" that makes the game unplayable.",Padro V.
Good card,rating rating-3,2019-10-12,10/12/2019 9:12:49 AM,"Pros: Lots of frames which is nice.Cons: Annoying coil wine on my unit
Huge 30-40 fps drops mid game that cause a crazy amount of stuttering that last for a minute which could be something else but the card but it didn't happen on my other card so I thought I'd mention it.Overall Review: The frames are nice and from what I've read you cant do much about the coil wine and the frame issue I'm not sure if it's the card or a driver or the game im playing but other then that I've been enjoying the card.",MICHAEL P.

- It's quiet.Cons: - EXPENSIVE
- EXPENSIVE
- Doesn't run as well as I thought it would.Overall Review: - I would recommend just getting a regular 2080 and not the Ti seeing as there is only about a 20 fps difference and it's half the price of the Ti.

"Looks great, has good features, but my card was... problomatic.",rating rating-1,2019-10-02,10/2/2019 6:54:11 PM,"Pros: Bios switch.
Well built and attractive case.
Power LEDs help communicate power issues.
Adequate connectivityCons: Model is prone to issues.
Overly long requiring a GPU brace.Overall Review: A few of my neighbors, friends, and relatives have Strix cards and only one had issues. I settled on this instead of a FTW as ASUS is one of the scant few partners I'd buy a flagship from, was cheaper, and had good reviews from people I know. My card had a bevy of issues.

I'd BSOD a few times.
GPU heat in a fully open case hit 90C a few times.
Had to manually set a fan curve as the fans did not act is any acceptable way, and GPU still was hitting low 80c of mild or average loads.
Screen would go black, distort, cut in and out among other issues.
Fans had a ridiculous level of coil whine at high levels.
Get so hot as to mess with the other components as I air cool.
Had issues with PSU cables staying in, as the +2 part of them had issues connecting.

I RMAd the card, and Newegg took good care of me (Props to Newegg). They did not have another Strix, so I just got a refund. Bought the EVGA FTW and have not had one issue with it.
I'm more than willing to use Asus tech, have been for years and my new PC has a Asus Mobo. I've had Asus GPUs before and they worked like a charm. Now I get a card that was more or less hostile in its build. I would of given a better review if I had received a replacement to compare it. All I have is the one card I got and it was trash. Sad as I like the over all look and the connectivity, granted not amazing, is just what I need for a GPU. The other features also look great on paper.",Austin M.
Asus... Never again,rating rating-1,2019-10-01,10/1/2019 1:57:22 PM,"Pros: Worked for 6 weeksCons: Card stopped working and started smoking during a game session.
Asus warranty is a joke.Overall Review: Tried to warranty the card. Mentioned that smoke came out of the card and they said they had to move me to a ""safety hazard"" warranty dept and they would call me back in 3 hours. Never called. Called them. They apologized and said that they would call me back within 24-48 hours. They also said they couldn't give me an ""advanced warranty"" (where they take your cc and send you a new card immediately and you send yours when you get it) because it's a safety hazard issue. Feel like I'm getting the runaround so I will just give up. Asus, never again.",Jeff L.
Super fast,rating rating-4,2019-09-22,9/22/2019 5:59:27 AM,"Pros: Fastest consumer graphics card if you don't count the Titan RTX.
Very Aesthetically pleasing.

Mine overclocks well but that can vary significantly gpu to gpu.Cons: Price
Not a drastic improvement over my Titan Xp
Asus Software sucks. (Aura/Ai suite)Overall Review: I purchased this card to pair with my 9900k. My previous gpu was a Titan Xp so I didn't expect a huge jump in performance but needed a second GPU for my wife's pc.

Overall I would recommend it for people who want to either play 4k60 ultra or 1440p/144hz ultra.

Awesome card,rating rating-4,2019-08-18,8/18/2019 4:04:24 PM,"Pros: -Out of the box my would boost to 1965mhz.
-Runs cool if you set the fan curves right. Mine will run pretty quite at 65-70% fan speed and that keeps it cool at about 58-60c.
-has rgb if that’s your flavor. + you can turn it off if you choose too.
-stable oc +150 on core and +1000 on memoryCons: - power limit isn’t enough only goes to 25 above normal.
-rgb switch to turn them off is on top of the card. So you have to open your case to turn them off. And if you run sli forget it unless you do it before you install second card.
-wish the power limit would go higher for more over locking.Overall Review: Used msi afterburner to set over clocks and used GPUz to see clocks and temps.
Overall this card works and is a great card for the $$ you spend on it. Would buy another if I could.",justin l.

I wanted this card so bad i saved for a few months to get it and now my build is done. on a 60hz monitor i pull 144 FPS. im still saving for a 1440p monitor. this thing is awesome, the RGB is sick, the card is fast, it doesnt even break a swear. it stays around 42c under load. ive never seen it higher. no need to OC this thing its already fast enough",David C.

- Highest temp reached was 61 degrees Celsius out of the box (Average is low 50s)
- I haven't even needed to custom overclock or water cool yet because there would be no pointCons: - It is big and I put it in a Lian Li 011 Dynamic with no problem so make sure you have a big case
- No sagging yet but maybe in the future it will start to sag just because it is so big/heavyOverall Review: - If you want to be able to do anything with your computer and play real life Minecraft then this is for you",Nicholas P.

Nonexistent quality control,rating rating-1,2019-07-17,7/17/2019 8:29:40 PM,"Pros: Auxiliary fan headerCons: I got 2 of these cards and on both of them, 2 of the 3 fans made a scratching noise (bad bearing).
Asus GPU Tweak is bug-infested to the point where it's unusable. The fan control graph UI for the middle fan is broken. And none of my settings are remembered.
The fans rev themselves every second unless I set them to minimum 30%. It sounds like a washing machine.Overall Review: Look at how many of the Open Box 2080 Ti's on Newegg are THIS CARD. This is an unfinished product that should have never left the factory.",Brad L.
Do you like coil whine?,rating rating-1,2019-07-16,7/16/2019 7:52:18 AM,"Pros: Runs cool & there are no other alarming issues.Cons: It has made me a whiner.Overall Review: I read the other reviews about this card (and the issues with coil whine) and still went ahead and purchased it. I should have paid attention to their warnings.

+90Mhz GPU Clock, +500MHz Memory Clock, + 25% Power Target runs around 70C at 80% fan speed under full load. Normal load runs quite.Cons: Expensive performance gain from GTX 1080 TI. 10 - 20 FPS gain depend on the game but nothing crazy.

Not a lot of games support ray tracing at the moment.

300W+ energy draw under full load...Overall Review: ""Coil whine"" high pitch noise from the capacitors were driving me nuts. (even at idle)

I was about to RMA this card but I then swapped the 6+2 pin connector ports just for haha, the whine magically stopped completely....

The only thing that is different is that one of the 6+2 connectors is from the PSU directly, one is from the PSU modular port. Still can't believe swapping the connectors fixed the issue, but lol I don't have to deal with RMA now.",Ho Y.

Card runs Cool -- not above 60C even at high load in gamesCons: Massive buzzing during games (No, it isn't my power supply, yes I run with two separate cables for each 8 pin connector). I don't like to play games with a headset unless I am actively talking to other people, and the sound is awful. Sometimes it goes away when FPS dips under 70 or so. I have framerate limited to my monitor's refresh rate (120 FPS) and...yeah.

Happens in Anthem
Happens in Destiny 2

Haven't listened for it in other games yet. But this is bad. I'll be contacting Newegg tomorrow to set up an RMA for this and, at the same time, will be buying a different brand card so that I have one to use while I wait, since this is the only video card I have and I'd rather not have an unusable computerOverall Review: I would not recommend this card to anyone unless that person is always using headphones or has a sound proof case.

Very quiet under load
Excellent build quality with the brace adding significant structural integrity to such a fat card
Great looking aesthetic that plays very well with Asus' Aura software and with lights off is color neutralCons: Absurd price. But this is more an nvidia thing than Asus. The premium over the Founder's Edition is worth it. The fact that Nvidia prices are so high to begin with though is ridiculous.Overall Review: I transitioned from a desk setup to a TV and couch setup and needed more performance for 4k. Had an Asus Strix 1080 Ti OC prior. The performance boost is significant and I haven't found a game yet that I have performance problems with keeping 60 fps in yet at max settings (AA on low).

Powerful but unreliable.,rating rating-1,2019-01-23,1/23/2019 1:39:17 PM,"Pros: Fast for an hour and a halfCons: This card worked for less than 2 hours. After about 2 hours of gameplay multiple monitors when dark. I rebooted and no longer had the Nvidia control panel. I saw artifacting at times, I had reboots and crashed to at times. I uninstalled and reinstalled Nvidia's 417 driver MANY times. It would also only boot up at 1024x768 resolution at times. This is insane to think that NVIDIA is not looking into this and fixing the issue faster. It is NOT only an issue with the FE models. Everything graced with RTX 2080 ti scares me now.

Powerful but unreliable.,rating rating-1,2019-01-23,1/23/2019 1:39:17 PM,"Pros: Fast for an hour and a halfCons: This card worked for less than 2 hours. After about 2 hours of gameplay multiple monitors when dark. I rebooted and no longer had the Nvidia control panel. I saw artifacting at times, I had reboots and crashed to at times. I uninstalled and reinstalled Nvidia's 417 driver MANY times. It would also only boot up at 1024x768 resolution at times.

ASUS ROG GeForce RTX 2080 Ti,rating rating-3,2018-12-26,12/26/2018 9:02:12 AM,Pros: Beast of a card handles games at high frame rates for 1440p high/ultra settings this card is well constructed solid built cooler my temps were low to mid 60’s under load in OC mode at a fan speed of around 40-50%Cons: Unfortunately had to RMA this card very dissapointed as this card with gst is just under 2k I’m experiencing extreme buzzing/coil whine not under load and under load as well it was so bad I could here it over my nine 120mm case fans at 2000rpmOverall Review: Giving three eggs only due to solid construction and cooling of the card,NATHAN C.
RTX 2080 TI Where is the quality?,rating rating-1,2018-12-21,12/21/2018 9:01:26 AM,"Pros: Ran cool
It was 20 -25% faster then the Titan Xp I was using prior
Extremely nice looking cardCons: New out of the box Fans are buzzing/rattling left one is the worst the middle one seems more random. its loud enough it can easily be heard with case fans on and side cover closed. I made video of it posted on Asus forum zero help from anyone. Coil whine just about as loud as the buzzing from the fans I could have lived with that but the fans are a deal breaker. (had zero coil whine from my Titan) When I removed the card to Rma I noticed manufacturer defects, every fan has individual blades with actual pieced missing from blades. I suspect that's the reason for the buzzing/rattle took pics posted on Asus forum also no replies. This part I was unlucky the card was a very poor over clocker in no way stable using the Nvidia scanner (auto over clocking tool). Newegg Rma process was great they made it super easy. Asked for Rma replacement then the reply (we no longer carrying the item we have arranged for a refund) so you guessed it no stock available.Overall Review: If you think the quality/control of the product increased with the price you would be wrong. How does a card like this make it to a customer for close to $1900 Canadian. Been buying hi-end Asus products for years could not be more disappointed with how this played out.",LYLE W.

"Does EVERYTHING, but the dishes T_T (Jokes aside)",rating rating-5,2018-11-19,11/19/2018 3:28:55 PM,"Pros: -Great graphics performance on games like Hitman maxed out at 180+ FPS
-Lighting is vibrant
- Comes with a fan head and RGB header
-Really built toughCons: -Very hard to find one (you will be refreshing the page many times hoping the ADD TO CARD feature is available)
-Expensive (but worth it)
-Geforce RTX Text near the PCI bracket doesn't glow (weird?)
-ASUS Aura needs to be updated since Aura doesn't recognize this card unless you download beta drivers (at the of release)
-Didn't come with Call of Duty 4 despite being a super luxurious itemOverall Review: -As a person upgrading from a dead 550 Ti, it takes a while to get accustomed with the new functions on a Turing card",Suzanne L.
First Ti Series I have bought,rating rating-5,2018-11-13,11/13/2018 7:23:59 PM,"Pros: -4K Ultra 60+FPS (Except Not, See Cons)
-Aura Sync is good, IDK why people talk trash
-Dare you to get temps above 60C
-Whisper QuietCons: -Not 60FPS at 4K res in many games, dips below 60 consistently with all graphical settings in games turned up (GTA V Advanced menu, Skyrim SE modded with 4k textures, distance mods, etc.). My option is this or a $10kGPU that may or may not do what I want. Probably won't as it 'wasn't intended for gaming'. So what do I do?
-Not really much else, just find it condescending that game developers include settings in games that we can't use at 60FPS even when we spend exorbitant amounts of money for hardware.
-TL:DR it is expensive.Overall Review: I like 4k 60FPS gaming better for everything, even CS:GO. It is expensive to game at this resolution; is it worth it?

It depends. If you're thinking about it and have read this far, then you should do it. And get a 4K monitor, 1440P and sync techs are a gimmick.",RICKY M.
