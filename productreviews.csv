"$1,279.99",Asus ROG Strix 2080ti (3day initial impressions),rating rating-5,2020-05-01,5/1/2020 2:36:25 PM,"Pros: premium quality feel
temps ( performance toggle) are pretty great actually even time spy it didn't heat up beyond reason.
metal backplate and inner support bar construction help with sag
its a gaming monster!
new fan design the fans are not as straight as with the 1080ti strix the new design directs air down into the card better.Cons: box was barren I mean yea its all about the card but a case badge, some stickers, heck msi gives a entire support bracket ( yea not needed due to inner support) but sill for a flagship product unboxing was a let down.
power indicator lights its a tiny gripe but the two white lights on the power cables wish I could toggle them yea its a neat troubleshooting feature but maybe after startup you could put them asleep in gpu tweek.Overall Review: overall you want the best go with asus rog strix",1stplayerz P.

quality controlOverall Review: This card was ""artifacting"" out of the box, as soon as i loaded into windows I noticed that letters in words such as SETTINGS were not being displayed (EX: S TTI GS). Day 1 I loaded up Raindow 6 Siege and noticed odd visuals on the main menu but that those did not carry over to the actual game so i didn't care too much. The reason i'm sending the card back now after 2 weeks of owning was because NOW BL3, BF4 and R6S do not start and crash before hitting the main menu, Dota 2 has really bad ""Artifacting"" that makes the game unplayable.",Padro V.

Huge 30-40 fps drops mid game that cause a crazy amount of stuttering that last for a minute which could be something else but the card but it didn't happen on my other card so I thought I'd mention it.Overall Review: The frames are nice and from what I've read you cant do much about the coil wine and the frame issue I'm not sure if it's the card or a driver or the game im playing but other then that I've been enjoying the card.",MICHAEL P.

- EXPENSIVE
- Doesn't run as well as I thought it would.Overall Review: - I would recommend just getting a regular 2080 and not the Ti seeing as there is only about a 20 fps difference and it's half the price of the Ti.

"$1,279.99","Looks great, has good features, but my card was... problomatic.",rating rating-1,2019-10-02,10/2/2019 6:54:11 PM,"Pros: Bios switch.
Well built and attractive case.
Power LEDs help communicate power issues.
Adequate connectivityCons: Model is prone to issues.
Overly long requiring a GPU brace.Overall Review: A few of my neighbors, friends, and relatives have Strix cards and only one had issues. I settled on this instead of a FTW as ASUS is one of the scant few partners I'd buy a flagship from, was cheaper, and had good reviews from people I know. My card had a bevy of issues.

I'd BSOD a few times.
GPU heat in a fully open case hit 90C a few times.
Had to manually set a fan curve as the fans did not act is any acceptable way, and GPU still was hitting low 80c of mild or average loads.
Screen would go black, distort, cut in and out among other issues.
Fans had a ridiculous level of coil whine at high levels.
Get so hot as to mess with the other components as I air cool.
Had issues with PSU cables staying in, as the +2 part of them had issues connecting.

I RMAd the card, and Newegg took good care of me (Props to Newegg). They did not have another Strix, so I just got a refund. Bought the EVGA FTW and have not had one issue with it.
I'm more than willing to use Asus tech, have been for years and my new PC has a Asus Mobo. I've had Asus GPUs before and they worked like a charm. Now I get a card that was more or less hostile in its build. I would of given a better review if I had received a replacement to compare it. All I have is the one card I got and it was trash. Sad as I like the over all look and the connectivity, granted not amazing, is just what I need for a GPU. The other features also look great on paper.",Austin M.

Asus warranty is a joke.Overall Review: Tried to warranty the card. Mentioned that smoke came out of the card and they said they had to move me to a ""safety hazard"" warranty dept and they would call me back in 3 hours. Never called. Called them. They apologized and said that they would call me back within 24-48 hours. They also said they couldn't give me an ""advanced warranty"" (where they take your cc and send you a new card immediately and you send yours when you get it) because it's a safety hazard issue. Feel like I'm getting the runaround so I will just give up. Asus, never again.",Jeff L.

"$1,279.99",Super fast,rating rating-4,2019-09-22,9/22/2019 5:59:27 AM,"Pros: Fastest consumer graphics card if you don't count the Titan RTX.
Very Aesthetically pleasing.
Good temps while being very quiet at stock settings.
Mine overclocks well but that can vary significantly gpu to gpu.Cons: Price
Not a drastic improvement over my Titan Xp
Asus Software sucks. (Aura/Ai suite)Overall Review: I purchased this card to pair with my 9900k. My previous gpu was a Titan Xp so I didn't expect a huge jump in performance but needed a second GPU for my wife's pc.

Overall I would recommend it for people who want to either play 4k60 ultra or 1440p/144hz ultra.

Mine has zero coil and Samsung memory.",Louis J.
"$1,279.99",Awesome card,rating rating-4,2019-08-18,8/18/2019 4:04:24 PM,"Pros: -Out of the box my would boost to 1965mhz.
-Runs cool if you set the fan curves right. Mine will run pretty quite at 65-70% fan speed and that keeps it cool at about 58-60c.
-has rgb if that’s your flavor. + you can turn it off if you choose too.
-stable oc +150 on core and +1000 on memoryCons: - power limit isn’t enough only goes to 25 above normal.
-rgb switch to turn them off is on top of the card. So you have to open your case to turn them off. And if you run sli forget it unless you do it before you install second card.
-wish the power limit would go higher for more over locking.Overall Review: Used msi afterburner to set over clocks and used GPUz to see clocks and temps.
Overall this card works and is a great card for the $$ you spend on it. Would buy another if I could.",justin l.

2. this is well made
3. its cosmetically beautiful
4. beefy and really adds style to a buildCons: 1. the price is kind of high, but you pay for what you get.Overall Review: anticipation killed me when waiting for this to arrive. I wanted this card so bad i saved for a few months to get it and now my build is done. on a 60hz monitor i pull 144 FPS. im still saving for a 1440p monitor. this thing is awesome, the RGB is sick, the card is fast, it doesnt even break a swear. it stays around 42c under load. ive never seen it higher. no need to OC this thing its already fast enough",David C.
"$1,279.99",G.O.D. of Graphics,rating rating-5,2019-08-01,8/1/2019 1:23:24 PM,"Pros: - Paired with Intel I9-9900K and GSkill Trident Z Royal (2x16GB)
- Handles every game I throw at it on Ultra settings out of the box
- Highest temp reached was 61 degrees Celsius out of the box (Average is low 50s)
- I haven't even needed to custom overclock or water cool yet because there would be no pointCons: - It is big and I put it in a Lian Li 011 Dynamic with no problem so make sure you have a big case
- No sagging yet but maybe in the future it will start to sag just because it is so big/heavyOverall Review: - If you want to be able to do anything with your computer and play real life Minecraft then this is for you",Nicholas P.
"$1,279.99",Too Sweet!,rating rating-5,2019-07-28,7/28/2019 8:07:11 AM,"Pros: Very Quiet, cool at full load with temps under 60.

"$1,279.99",Nonexistent quality control,rating rating-1,2019-07-17,7/17/2019 8:29:40 PM,"Pros: Auxiliary fan headerCons: I got 2 of these cards and on both of them, 2 of the 3 fans made a scratching noise (bad bearing).
Asus GPU Tweak is bug-infested to the point where it's unusable. The fan control graph UI for the middle fan is broken. And none of my settings are remembered.
The fans rev themselves every second unless I set them to minimum 30%. It sounds like a washing machine.Overall Review: Look at how many of the Open Box 2080 Ti's on Newegg are THIS CARD. This is an unfinished product that should have never left the factory.",Brad L.
"$1,279.99",Do you like coil whine?,rating rating-1,2019-07-16,7/16/2019 7:52:18 AM,"Pros: Runs cool & there are no other alarming issues.Cons: It has made me a whiner.Overall Review: I read the other reviews about this card (and the issues with coil whine) and still went ahead and purchased it. I should have paid attention to their warnings.
It whines when playing games. it whines when not playing games. it whines when surfing the web. it just whines.",Ethan M.
"$1,279.99",Expensive performance,rating rating-4,2019-07-10,7/10/2019 7:35:03 PM,"Pros: Run everything maxed out.

+90Mhz GPU Clock, +500MHz Memory Clock, + 25% Power Target runs around 70C at 80% fan speed under full load. Normal load runs quite.Cons: Expensive performance gain from GTX 1080 TI. 10 - 20 FPS gain depend on the game but nothing crazy.

Not a lot of games support ray tracing at the moment.

300W+ energy draw under full load...Overall Review: ""Coil whine"" high pitch noise from the capacitors were driving me nuts. (even at idle)

I was about to RMA this card but I then swapped the 6+2 pin connector ports just for haha, the whine magically stopped completely....

The only thing that is different is that one of the 6+2 connectors is from the PSU directly, one is from the PSU modular port. Still can't believe swapping the connectors fixed the issue, but lol I don't have to deal with RMA now.",Ho Y.

Coming from a 1080 strix i knew that card would be silent like all other strix's cards, well.... NOTCons: At first there was coil whine, i thought it was not that bad and that it would go away as i run it.... well i was wrong, now its so bad i dont even want to game with it... sucks to have a 4-5K pc to have such a noise coming from it... when i showed this to one of my friend he was asking if i really paid almost 2k for this ... what a shame, i will probably contact asus soon and get it rma'd..Overall Review: I heard EVGA are much less likely to have coil whine...
The worst on that is asus replying to comments here saying that people with "" sensitive "" ears to play with headphone... this is just unbelievable haha

will update the review once i get a REAL silent card.. tbc",sebastien s.

Haven't listened for it in other games yet. But this is bad.

Extremely nice looking cardCons: New out of the box Fans are buzzing/rattling left one is the worst the middle one seems more random. its loud enough it can easily be heard with case fans on and side cover closed. I made video of it posted on Asus forum zero help from anyone. Coil whine just about as loud as the buzzing from the fans I could have lived with that but the fans are a deal breaker. (had zero coil whine from my Titan) When I removed the card to Rma I noticed manufacturer defects, every fan has individual blades with actual pieced missing from blades. I suspect that's the reason for the buzzing/rattle took pics posted on Asus forum also no replies. This part I was unlucky the card was a very poor over clocker in no way stable using the Nvidia scanner (auto over clocking tool). Newegg Rma process was great they made it super easy.

Good freesync, no tearing
Cost/ValueCons: Crashed often with out of the box settings (DCS and Boarderlands 3), It appeared the default fan curves were to low and the card would get hot during idle times as the fans were not spinning until some load was applied. Had to tweak fan curves to always keep the fans turning.Overall Review: I would recommend for anyone comfortable modifying fan curves, and tweaking OC-ing or undervolt-ing

I used manual tuning for volt settings and tweaked the fan curve in Adrenaline 2020 and have not had any bad luck with crashes after under-volting. In this case I used 1.027mV with max freq 1950mhz and clocked the vram to 1850mhz, I created a fan curve to run fans at 50% for temps under 60c and then increase as it gets hotter.

I traded a little performance for stability and chip life.

Update, after 4 months of use:
I wish i never went with this gpu and I should have went with similar nvidia.
I tried patiently to wait for driver updates since 19.8.2, now we are on 20.4.2 still unstable.
Black screens and hard resart, or Green screen and self reboot, or crashes stating error occurred in amdkdmap* or similar.
I have tried many things, updated the psu and even reinstalled windows.
Cant play games with any long missions knowing theres a high chance of crashing.
If I put my older nvidia 1060 card in my system I can play for hours with no issues, so its the gpu.
As a bonus, I found out the hard way it was not compatible with HP Reverb - screens would not power on, HP provided a firmware update due to how the AMD driver works, once again the HP Reverb worked fine with the older nvidia card but not the AMD. Now still having issue with the HP Reverb were AMD driver does not fill entire resolution of the display panels, so I have a VR device marketed for its high resolution but the AMD card cant feed it its native resolution, and again my 4yr old nvidia runs the HP Reverb fine full rez edge to edge.... facepalm.

-Great for 1080p/1440p gaming
-Was concerned about cooling but seems to be holding at around 70C under loadCons: -A little unstable
-had to reinstall software/drivers, fixed errors and most crashing issuesOverall Review: Long story short, I really like this graphics card. I wouldn't recommend this card to everyone, I enjoy tinkering with overclocking and problem solving and I recognize this card wouldn't be a great choice for someone who just wants to plug in a card and have it work 100% out of the box. That being said if you can handle a little bit of instability the 5700 xt is a beast for the price point- NVIDIA doesn't have anything that matches it.
I'm running slightly OC'd at 2100 mhz as my card is unstable beyond 2120 and bringing it down a little more seemed to help with intermittent crashes. I haven't experimented with undervolting yet but I've heard good things so I mean to try it.
The initial install of the AMD Radeon software was throwing frequent AMDRSServ.exe error codes but reinstalling resolved this. Reinstalling drivers also seemed to help with crashes, not sure what went wrong with the first install.
In a mid-sized case with 5 fans (3 in, 2 out) seems to hold at around 70C under load with a side panel intake fan blowing almost right on it.. I know a lot of people have had problems managing heat but that hasn't been my experience.
Personally, I would buy this card again. Whether it's worthwhile for you would be dependent on whether you value stability or performance. For the same price you could pick up a 2060 Super for a perfectly stable plug and play graphics card, or you could go with the 5700 xt for more power at the cost of having to optimize it yourself a little bit and a crash here and there. It's also perfectly possible AMD will figure out their stability issues and this card will become the clear hands down winner for the price point. My bet's on AMD.

Update:
After owning this card for 3 months and tweaking its performance a lot more as well as applying the recent driver updates the card's stability has improved. I've stopped getting black screens and error messages while playing games since undervolting the card and applying the 2020 driver updates. Driver stability in general has improved, at least in my experience, and undervolting provides a couple fps performance loss for greater stability and even better thermals so I'm happy to do it.

Problems I still have with the card are when playing in modern games (specifically RE2 and 3 remakes) with Radeon Image Sharpening on, picking up an item (which automatically opens the menu) will sometimes crash the game. I've never had this problem with image sharpening off and it's listed in the known driver issues (as something along the lines of a ""task change"") so I'm confident this is the problem. The other problem is when playing graphically demanding modern games on one monitor (1440p) with another program such as chrome open on the secondary monitor (1080p) the game will sometimes crash or on rare occasion cause the computer to crash and restart. Issues with multi-monitor setups are also a known issue with current Radeon drivers.",Elyse B.

$409.99,Great Card for those who tinker!,rating rating-4,2020-04-30,4/30/2020 12:08:17 PM,"Pros: - Ridiculous performance. Stock outperforms the 2060 as expected. Mine scored in the upper percentiles of userbenchmarked 5700 XT's, and it destroyed 2060(S) by scoring 114%. OC pushes a bit more to about 117% and is line with a 2070, or a 2070S depending on the game.
- Sleek design, I paired it with a x570 Gaming X and the RGB Fusion 2.0 works like a charm. The RGB gigabyte logo is nice, the backplate is nothing special but a nice blank aesthetic. Material feels great.
- Stock temps are great, 70-85c under full load, Junction Temp hits 110c highest, which is within AMD spec.
- AMD OC puts this card from 2070MHZ. to 2130MHZ. Gives me about 5-15fps depending on the settings.
-1080p ultra on WWZ and Division 2 gets me easily 100+ FPS. Scored 11k on WWZ on stock. Can't remember Div 2.Cons: - Card can run hot if you OC it despite insanely good airflow. There may be thermal controlling issues with my card as any OC runs in the 80s really fast, at 46% fan speed.
- Fans can get LOUD. 50% fan speed has the fans going upwards of 3k+ RPM, and it is like you've got industrial fans in the computer. Not sure why even allow fans go that fast, and 3 of them at that. If you plan to OC, be prepared for a lot of tinkering and perhaps fixes to the card.
-Noticed some flickering here and there, and has some compatibility issues with some apps (Yi Home)Overall Review: Overall, really great card for the price. Beats a 2060S stock for stock, and I assume 2060S OC'd as well even on stock. Looks nice, and if OC'd is on par with a 2070 or a 2070S. No issues so far except for some momentary screen flickerings due to using OBS to record that only happen on boot of some games. Great card for someone who wants to plug and play. No driver issues.

However, if you're an enthusiast and bought this card to get the greatest bang for buck for OC, be prepared for lots of tinkering/troubleshooting. Thermals on OC take quite some time to get straight, and may require opening it up for thermal pad swapped or applying more pressure.

No driver issues on all AMD systems.. x470 and x570. One is installed on a B450 chipset with a 2400g. I noticed with higher frequency ram it becomes more unstable or when overclocking the card it will crash but nothing happens when at stock. AT ALL nothing happens when stock.Cons: - you would be suprised at what the competitors P.R. team and funding can do to another company. Even reviews are fake these days just like any other F.B. account or t#itter account.Overall Review: - I've installed many many of the 5700 XT models and never had a driver issue on my end.

GIGABYTEs software is absolute trash. I can't control the RGB and I've taped over the logo with some electric tape.
The first day I had this, I didn't realize I had to go into the software specifically to enable the fans to run, which imo should just be enabled out of the boxOverall Review: This doesn't feel like it's performing that much better than my last GPU (Nvidia 1050-ti) which is very disappointing. I was hoping to see a much steeper improvement, and while this can run better graphics settings, the stuttering and crashes aren't worth it.

$409.99,Great Card - I have some issues though,rating rating-3,2020-02-28,2/28/2020 1:28:56 PM,"Pros: -Great graphics for gaming and streamingCons: -When the computer is woken up from sleeping/hibernating, the screen is solid red or solid blue (not the same thing as a blue screen of death)Overall Review: Before buying this card, I did research to see which of the 5700XTs had the best stock cooling. Gigabyte's card was one of the top listed cards along with the Sapphire Pulse. I went with Gigabyte due to the design.

Playing games it runs great and rarely ever does it have to rev up the fans to cool down the card. Then again I do not play for long periods and my computer case has three 140mm fans for intake and three for out.

Only problem I have run into with this card is when the computer falls asleep, the screen turns black as it should. If I wake up the computer right away the screen works fine. If I leave it asleep for about 5 min or more and try to wake up the computer, my screen wakes up most of the time with full red color or blue (not the same as Blue Screen of Death), it was green once. But the issue happens 100% of the time if left in sleep mode for more than 5min.

Have tried everything to fix this issue by:
-Re-seating the GPU
-Using different PCIe slot
-Unplugging and plugging cables back in
-Screen still comes up oddly colored after the computer boots back up
-Downgrading PCIe version to PCIe3 instead of default PCIe4
-A forum said incompatibility between motherboard X570 with older CPU 2700X
-Used different monitors
-Still the same color when swapped out during that state
-Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable
-Used different cables
-Still the same color when swapped out during that state
-Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable
-Updated Graphics Drivers
-Downgraded Graphics Drivers

No rhyme or reason to them. Sometimes get an ""out of video memory"" message (8 GB vram! ....Really!!???)Overall Review: I wish I had dug deeper into the reviews before I bought this card.

- Runs decently cool for a high end card, especially in the 5700 series
- Gigabyte! One of my favorite third party card vendorsCons: - Very unstable
- Persistent driver issues 6+ months after release
- Will spend more time troubleshooting than playing some daysOverall Review: I upgraded to this card from an Rx 580 and I really wanted to stick with team AMD. AMD is killing it with their CPUs, but their GPUs are lagging and this card is a prime example. The price to performance on paper is killer, but that's just the hardware. The drivers are a broken mess that have not been fixed since release. I've tried every major release from 19.10.1 to the most current driver and each one pops up new issues with new fixes (turn off many extra features, only use one monitor, etc). When paying 400 for a graphics card one should not have to turn off many of the features of the software or not be able to use a muilti-monitor set-up.

A quick google of any 5700 driver errors will get you countless solutions, and believe me I've tried them all:
- New PSU (with a cable to each GPU power connector)
- Disable XMP
- Fresh install of Windows
- Undervolt / downclock

Even with all of those changes, still crashes constantly when gaming across multiple platforms. I really wanted to like this card and recommend it to people, but I just can't. The extra performance for the price isn't just worth it. At this point I wish I could return and go team green.",Jason v.

-With new or old drivers installed, and latest bios update, this thing would absolutely not run any games, would either crash immediately or after a few minutes.
- My monitor would not detect the card upon starting up the computer, had to reset up to 3 times before it would actually give me visuals.
- Flickering and red outline along edge of screen when the card actually (barely) worked. Stuttering was very prominent when it decided to function.
- Most recent card randomly turned my screen black and fans started spinning at what sounded like maximum speed, had to shut off the power supply switch to prevent any damage to my pc!Overall Review: After getting fed up with all 3 defective cards, I put in my old 1060 6gb card along with installing the newest drivers and everything worked like a dime.

$409.99,Either got a faulty card or there are some real horrible driver problems that dont have a fix yet.,rating rating-2,2020-01-28,1/28/2020 10:58:31 AM,"Pros: Worked normally in some games.Cons: Stuttery mess in most games. Clock speed keeps fluctuating between 400Mhz and 1900Mhz causing massive stutters in most games.

Some games don't have the clock speed going higher than 900mhz leaving a really horrible experience where the fps keeps dropping below 144 fps all the way down to 60fps. It would get a maximum of 160 fps in games that are supposed to go up till 400 even.

CsGo is one of the examples. Literally lowest settings gives unplayable fps. Less than 60 fps and even that stutters. The weird thing is if i set settings to ultra it gives slightly more playable frames but still would drop to 80-90fps everytime i flick in CSGO.

I've tried tons of possible fixes (DDU, Fresh Windows install, etc), absolutely nothing works. There is a post on Amd's subreddits with 500+ Upvotes of people having the exact same problem from rx 5700xt, so its not that uncommon it seems.

The post describe issues on rx 5700xt of multiple brands not just gigabyte cards.Overall Review: Gave it a 2 star since it worked for some games as its supposed to like Witcher 3 and Forza Horizon 4.

But older games such as Witcher 2 and CSGO are just a mess.

Overly long requiring a GPU brace.Overall Review: A few of my neighbors, friends, and relatives have Strix cards and only one had issues. I settled on this instead of a FTW as ASUS is one of the scant few partners I'd buy a flagship from, was cheaper, and had good reviews from people I know. My card had a bevy of issues.

I'm more than willing to use Asus tech, have been for years and my new PC has a Asus Mobo. I've had Asus GPUs before and they worked like a charm. Now I get a card that was more or less hostile in its build. I would of given a better review if I had received a replacement to compare it. All I have is the one card I got and it was trash. Sad as I like the over all look and the connectivity, granted not amazing, is just what I need for a GPU. The other features also look great on paper.",Austin M.

Asus warranty is a joke.Overall Review: Tried to warranty the card. Mentioned that smoke came out of the card and they said they had to move me to a ""safety hazard"" warranty dept and they would call me back in 3 hours. Never called. Called them. They apologized and said that they would call me back within 24-48 hours. They also said they couldn't give me an ""advanced warranty"" (where they take your cc and send you a new card immediately and you send yours when you get it) because it's a safety hazard issue. Feel like I'm getting the runaround so I will just give up. Asus, never again.",Jeff L.

$409.99,Great Value,rating rating-4,2020-05-09,5/9/2020 8:36:29 AM,"Pros: Amazing Performance for the price it's offered
Radeon drivers come with a lot of tweaking available in software
Drivers have matured very well at this point.Cons: The card does get very warm so any large OC's maybe difficult.
It is a larger card, so check clearances.
No support for DX12 UltimateOverall Review: Great Value, amazing performance, stable driver, but lacking in forward features.",Matthew M.
$409.99,"Runs great for me, but not out of the box",rating rating-1,2020-05-07,5/7/2020 6:03:45 PM,"Pros: Great for 1080p on high+ settings
Good freesync, no tearing
Cost/ValueCons: Crashed often with out of the box settings (DCS and Boarderlands 3), It appeared the default fan curves were to low and the card would get hot during idle times as the fans were not spinning until some load was applied. Had to tweak fan curves to always keep the fans turning.Overall Review: I would recommend for anyone comfortable modifying fan curves, and tweaking OC-ing or undervolt-ing

I used manual tuning for volt settings and tweaked the fan curve in Adrenaline 2020 and have not had any bad luck with crashes after under-volting. In this case I used 1.027mV with max freq 1950mhz and clocked the vram to 1850mhz, I created a fan curve to run fans at 50% for temps under 60c and then increase as it gets hotter.

I traded a little performance for stability and chip life.

Update, after 4 months of use:
I wish i never went with this gpu and I should have went with similar nvidia.
I tried patiently to wait for driver updates since 19.8.2, now we are on 20.4.2 still unstable.
Black screens and hard resart, or Green screen and self reboot, or crashes stating error occurred in amdkdmap* or similar.
I have tried many things, updated the psu and even reinstalled windows.
Cant play games with any long missions knowing theres a high chance of crashing.
If I put my older nvidia 1060 card in my system I can play for hours with no issues, so its the gpu.
As a bonus, I found out the hard way it was not compatible with HP Reverb - screens would not power on, HP provided a firmware update due to how the AMD driver works, once again the HP Reverb worked fine with the older nvidia card but not the AMD. Now still having issue with the HP Reverb were AMD driver does not fill entire resolution of the display panels, so I have a VR device marketed for its high resolution but the AMD card cant feed it its native resolution, and again my 4yr old nvidia runs the HP Reverb fine full rez edge to edge.... facepalm.

High level performance and benchmarking for the priceCons: -Drivers need serious work

$409.99,Pretty Good Job So Far,rating rating-4,2020-05-04,5/4/2020 9:38:21 PM,"Pros: -Unmatched performance for price
-Great for 1080p/1440p gaming
-Was concerned about cooling but seems to be holding at around 70C under loadCons: -A little unstable
-had to reinstall software/drivers, fixed errors and most crashing issuesOverall Review: Long story short, I really like this graphics card. I wouldn't recommend this card to everyone, I enjoy tinkering with overclocking and problem solving and I recognize this card wouldn't be a great choice for someone who just wants to plug in a card and have it work 100% out of the box. That being said if you can handle a little bit of instability the 5700 xt is a beast for the price point- NVIDIA doesn't have anything that matches it.
I'm running slightly OC'd at 2100 mhz as my card is unstable beyond 2120 and bringing it down a little more seemed to help with intermittent crashes. I haven't experimented with undervolting yet but I've heard good things so I mean to try it.
The initial install of the AMD Radeon software was throwing frequent AMDRSServ.exe error codes but reinstalling resolved this. Reinstalling drivers also seemed to help with crashes, not sure what went wrong with the first install.
In a mid-sized case with 5 fans (3 in, 2 out) seems to hold at around 70C under load with a side panel intake fan blowing almost right on it.. I know a lot of people have had problems managing heat but that hasn't been my experience.
Personally, I would buy this card again. Whether it's worthwhile for you would be dependent on whether you value stability or performance. For the same price you could pick up a 2060 Super for a perfectly stable plug and play graphics card, or you could go with the 5700 xt for more power at the cost of having to optimize it yourself a little bit and a crash here and there. It's also perfectly possible AMD will figure out their stability issues and this card will become the clear hands down winner for the price point. My bet's on AMD.

Update:
After owning this card for 3 months and tweaking its performance a lot more as well as applying the recent driver updates the card's stability has improved. I've stopped getting black screens and error messages while playing games since undervolting the card and applying the 2020 driver updates. Driver stability in general has improved, at least in my experience, and undervolting provides a couple fps performance loss for greater stability and even better thermals so I'm happy to do it.

Problems I still have with the card are when playing in modern games (specifically RE2 and 3 remakes) with Radeon Image Sharpening on, picking up an item (which automatically opens the menu) will sometimes crash the game. I've never had this problem with image sharpening off and it's listed in the known driver issues (as something along the lines of a ""task change"") so I'm confident this is the problem. The other problem is when playing graphically demanding modern games on one monitor (1440p) with another program such as chrome open on the secondary monitor (1080p) the game will sometimes crash or on rare occasion cause the computer to crash and restart. Issues with multi-monitor setups are also a known issue with current Radeon drivers.",Elyse B.

$409.99,Great Card for those who tinker!,rating rating-4,2020-04-30,4/30/2020 12:08:17 PM,"Pros: - Ridiculous performance. Stock outperforms the 2060 as expected. Mine scored in the upper percentiles of userbenchmarked 5700 XT's, and it destroyed 2060(S) by scoring 114%. OC pushes a bit more to about 117% and is line with a 2070, or a 2070S depending on the game.
- Sleek design, I paired it with a x570 Gaming X and the RGB Fusion 2.0 works like a charm. The RGB gigabyte logo is nice, the backplate is nothing special but a nice blank aesthetic. Material feels great.
- Stock temps are great, 70-85c under full load, Junction Temp hits 110c highest, which is within AMD spec.
- AMD OC puts this card from 2070MHZ. to 2130MHZ. Gives me about 5-15fps depending on the settings.
-1080p ultra on WWZ and Division 2 gets me easily 100+ FPS. Scored 11k on WWZ on stock. Can't remember Div 2.Cons: - Card can run hot if you OC it despite insanely good airflow. There may be thermal controlling issues with my card as any OC runs in the 80s really fast, at 46% fan speed.
- Fans can get LOUD. 50% fan speed has the fans going upwards of 3k+ RPM, and it is like you've got industrial fans in the computer. Not sure why even allow fans go that fast, and 3 of them at that. If you plan to OC, be prepared for a lot of tinkering and perhaps fixes to the card.
-Noticed some flickering here and there, and has some compatibility issues with some apps (Yi Home)Overall Review: Overall, really great card for the price. Beats a 2060S stock for stock, and I assume 2060S OC'd as well even on stock. Looks nice, and if OC'd is on par with a 2070 or a 2070S. No issues so far except for some momentary screen flickerings due to using OBS to record that only happen on boot of some games. Great card for someone who wants to plug and play. No driver issues.

However, if you're an enthusiast and bought this card to get the greatest bang for buck for OC, be prepared for lots of tinkering/troubleshooting. Thermals on OC take quite some time to get straight, and may require opening it up for thermal pad swapped or applying more pressure.

Gigabyte's card was one of the top listed cards along with the Sapphire Pulse. I went with Gigabyte due to the design.

Playing games it runs great and rarely ever does it have to rev up the fans to cool down the card. Then again I do not play for long periods and my computer case has three 140mm fans for intake and three for out.

Only problem I have run into with this card is when the computer falls asleep, the screen turns black as it should. If I wake up the computer right away the screen works fine. If I leave it asleep for about 5 min or more and try to wake up the computer, my screen wakes up most of the time with full red color or blue (not the same as Blue Screen of Death), it was green once. But the issue happens 100% of the time if left in sleep mode for more than 5min.

Have tried everything to fix this issue by:
-Re-seating the GPU
-Using different PCIe slot
-Unplugging and plugging cables back in
-Screen still comes up oddly colored after the computer boots back up
-Downgrading PCIe version to PCIe3 instead of default PCIe4
-A forum said incompatibility between motherboard X570 with older CPU 2700X
-Used different monitors
-Still the same color when swapped out during that state
-Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable

$409.99,Not worth the gamble,rating rating-2,2020-02-19,2/19/2020 7:38:22 PM,"Pros: - Great price to performance
- Runs decently cool for a high end card, especially in the 5700 series
- Gigabyte! One of my favorite third party card vendorsCons: - Very unstable
- Persistent driver issues 6+ months after release
- Will spend more time troubleshooting than playing some daysOverall Review: I upgraded to this card from an Rx 580 and I really wanted to stick with team AMD. AMD is killing it with their CPUs, but their GPUs are lagging and this card is a prime example. The price to performance on paper is killer, but that's just the hardware. The drivers are a broken mess that have not been fixed since release. I've tried every major release from 19.10.1 to the most current driver and each one pops up new issues with new fixes (turn off many extra features, only use one monitor, etc). When paying 400 for a graphics card one should not have to turn off many of the features of the software or not be able to use a muilti-monitor set-up.

A quick google of any 5700 driver errors will get you countless solutions, and believe me I've tried them all:
- New PSU (with a cable to each GPU power connector)
- Disable XMP
- Fresh install of Windows
- Undervolt / downclock

Even with all of those changes, still crashes constantly when gaming across multiple platforms. I really wanted to like this card and recommend it to people, but I just can't. The extra performance for the price isn't just worth it. At this point I wish I could return and go team green.",Jason v.
$409.99,"Meh. Good card, but not worth what it costs.",rating rating-2,2020-02-19,2/19/2020 1:17:17 PM,"Pros: When its not loaded too much, it works great. Smooth, quiet, fast. Optimal for watching youtube videos, excel spreadsheets, etc. Don't ask too much of it though...Cons: Under load, it leaves a lot to be desired.

- Absolute power hog
- Doesn't seem very compatible with a full AMD system; constantly hangs, crashes games.
- Drivers are a joke; audio over HDMI snaps, crackles, pops like breakfast cereal. Ruins games, straight up.Overall Review: Wouldn't recommend this card.

I was basically told that if it failed during stress test then return for a replacement if not than it was a driver issue and to contact AMD to see if there is another driver.

is amd's most powerful card to date (could be second to the radeon vii idk)Cons: AMD's drivers are absolute trash. you can't play a game without having the gpu crash and require your oc to be hard reset before you can use it again. im legit playing a 1080p game with the frame rate capped at 75 since thats the moniter refresh rate till i get an upgrade and the card cant handle it and crashes. completely disappointed. i looked up my problem and turns out thousands have the same issue too. this is what i get for choosing the 5700xt over the 2070 super because this was cheaper.
i'd recommend you save up for the 2070 super or just get a 2060 if youre looking for something of the same price range. may be less efficient but atleast it works.Overall Review: DO NOT BUY TILL AMD FIXES THEIR DRIVERS

-With new or old drivers installed, and latest bios update, this thing would absolutely not run any games, would either crash immediately or after a few minutes.
- My monitor would not detect the card upon starting up the computer, had to reset up to 3 times before it would actually give me visuals.
- Flickering and red outline along edge of screen when the card actually (barely) worked. Stuttering was very prominent when it decided to function.
- Most recent card randomly turned my screen black and fans started spinning at what sounded like maximum speed, had to shut off the power supply switch to prevent any damage to my pc!Overall Review: After getting fed up with all 3 defective cards, I put in my old 1060 6gb card along with installing the newest drivers and everything worked like a dime. Games and applications would run without problems. I strongly advise everyone who’s enticed by the deals that this card has frequently to STAY AWAY FROM THIS CARD!

$409.99,Either got a faulty card or there are some real horrible driver problems that dont have a fix yet.,rating rating-2,2020-01-28,1/28/2020 10:58:31 AM,"Pros: Worked normally in some games.Cons: Stuttery mess in most games. Clock speed keeps fluctuating between 400Mhz and 1900Mhz causing massive stutters in most games.

Some games don't have the clock speed going higher than 900mhz leaving a really horrible experience where the fps keeps dropping below 144 fps all the way down to 60fps. It would get a maximum of 160 fps in games that are supposed to go up till 400 even.

CsGo is one of the examples. Literally lowest settings gives unplayable fps. Less than 60 fps and even that stutters. The weird thing is if i set settings to ultra it gives slightly more playable frames but still would drop to 80-90fps everytime i flick in CSGO.

I've tried tons of possible fixes (DDU, Fresh Windows install, etc), absolutely nothing works. There is a post on Amd's subreddits with 500+ Upvotes of people having the exact same problem from rx 5700xt, so its not that uncommon it seems.

The post describe issues on rx 5700xt of multiple brands not just gigabyte cards.Overall Review: Gave it a 2 star since it worked for some games as its supposed to like Witcher 3 and Forza Horizon 4.

But older games such as Witcher 2 and CSGO are just a mess.

Made me literally stop playing Apex Legends since its so stuttery that my gtx 1060 3gb would perform better.

$409.99,Great card but.....,rating rating-4,2020-01-21,1/21/2020 11:02:52 PM,"Pros: Price vs Performance
Good cooling solution
Subtle RGB
Not a bad looking cardCons: Stock thermal pasteOverall Review: I have had this card since 1/9/20
I did my research and decided to go with this card because of the good cooling solution it had vs other 5700xt models out there, the three fans and heatsink do a great job keeping the card run cool.

Where the problem lies is in the use of the thermal paste, i'm not sure if its the cheapest stuff they could get to save money or the application method (thinking a combo of both) but when you start to push higher resolutions while gaming and maxing out what the card can do the temps will start to rise uncomfortably high. My temps on resident evil 2 remake at 1800p, locked 60fps and the highest of settings saw the cards junction temperature sitting around 105c, which was a bit to much for me.

I had a tube of Artic MX4 thermal paste lying around. I decided to open up the card and repaste. What i fount out by doing so was that they used very little thermal paste, the application was not that bad but they just did not use enough of it, even if they did use a little more i'm not sure how much it would of help cause i'm pretty sure they are using the cheapest stuff.

After i repasted with the MX4, under the same settings and resolution in resident evil 2 remake the card would hover around 85c for the junction temperature, i say that is a pretty significant improvement over the stock paste which goes to show just how bad the stuff they are using really is.

So overall this is a great card if you are interested in a 5700xt, just make sure you repaste with something that will actually do a better job at keeping the card cooler under full load like Artic MX4, Noctua H1, Thermal Grizzly etc..",David C.

+incredible price to performance ratio. you gotta go rtx 2070 super to get (a tiny bit) better and that is a much more expensive card.

-i cannot get this card to report for any kind of monitoring. cpu-z , core temp, etc., can all identify the card, but get no information from it. i don't know why.Overall Review: i've been using nvidia for the last 10 years because they just made better cards (obviously my opinion). this is the first card by amd in a long time that i felt got close enough in the range of performance i was looking for, and i have been mostly pleased with it. the only issues i have with it, are the ones listed above, and one of those is manufacturer specific, while the other i have not been able to pin down at all, so it may be just me. i would recommend the 5700 xt to anyone looking in this range.",john m.
$409.99,Extremely Powerful Card!,rating rating-5,2020-01-16,1/16/2020 4:13:15 PM,"Pros: I got this card about two weeks ago, and was incredibly excited as it is a massive upgrade from my old 1050ti. Setup was fairly easy, and getting it up and running only took about 30 minutes. Cranks frames on all of my games on high/ultra settings, and the Radeon Adrenalin Software 2020 provides a slick interface for monitoring performance! Never seen the GPU go above 70c, averages at about 65c while gaming. GPU Junction maxes out at 90c during furmark (extremely intensive GPU stress test). The design of the card itself is very nice and sleek, with minimal RGB on the gigabyte logo on the side of the card.Cons: It's well known that AMD is suffering from driver problems, and I did experience a few of those while gaming, especially while playing Modern Warfare on high settings (seems like a memory leak with high textures on). All other games seem to run with no problems at all. This card is also very power hungry, and lead to me needing a new power supply to run games without a reboot. Once I got a nicer power supply, this problem stopped (Corsair CX750m -> Seasonic Focus SSR-650).Overall Review: Would recommend this GPU if you aren't afraid of doing a little debugging! It's extremely powerful for the price, and will run every game I throw at it.",Cade R.
$409.99,Easy setup and great performance,rating rating-4,2020-01-16,1/16/2020 2:41:33 PM,"Pros: -Easy to install
-Looks good
-Great performance
-User Friendly RGB Fusion 2.0 compatibilityCons: -Partial screen flashing/lines across the top corner of my monitor when using display port cable
-Only one HDMI portOverall Review: I was using a nvidia geforce gtx 1050ti before this card and wow is there a performance boost. Playing R6 Siege for example on ultra settings gets me about 180-250 fps on the rx 5700xt when I was getting about 100-120 fps on medium/low settings with my 1050ti. The card looks great as I have it synced with the rest of my rig with rgb fusion 2.0 and it couldn't be an easier install.

The one issue I have is that I use two monitors. The card has 3 Displayport and 1 HDMI slot. On my first monitor, I used the HDMI since it doesn't have a displayport slot. The second monitor, I have a displayport cable plugged into it since it does have the port for it. After Uninstalling all of the nvidia drivers and running ddu multiple times, I downloaded AMD's Radeon Adrenalin software and updated the drivers for the card to the most recent version as of 1/16/2020.

My monitor using HDMI has no issues with video output. The second one using displayport has very random flashing in the top right corner of the screen. It flashes and has lines and just glitches out randomly. I've tried Using a different displayport slot on the GPU and it doesn't change anything. I've also plugged the HDMI into this monitor and it works fine with HDMI.

I don't know if it is a driver issue or if there's something wrong with the brand new cable I bought for the card but I'd rather not have to buy a Displayport to DVI adapter. For now I'll live with the flashing since it's on my secondary monitor. Outside of the flashing, I love the card.",Gerrit T.

Im lucky to get 100fps on CSGO where before I could get well above that
Minecraft runs so bad that even on 12 chunks I still barely get 60fps, before I could get 60 locked at 20 chunks.
Pretty much all of my flatscreen games ran better on my old gigabyte 1060 3gb, so Im not really sure what to even say at this point, I just spent more money for less performance.
On top of the already low performance, all of my games stutter every 5 seconds or so (excluding vr once again)
Horrible coil whine, every time I move the mouse or scroll a page it makes a loud buzzing soundOverall Review: Clearly I lost the lottery here and got a bad card, I know many people are thinking I didnt try to troubleshoot enough, but I did.

I had hoped with the online posted benchmarks, youtube reviews, etc that I had made a smart purchase. These were suppose to be fairly on par with the 2070 which was considerably more money. Both cards, in 2 separate computers, have problems with freezing in games, jittery motion, low frames, broken sound. In order to make the card function for even a short amount of time, I have had to go through and manually undervolt the cards, change settings that shouldn't have to be changed, and turn off certain features of games to keep from freezing. ALL of which should not have to be done on a brand new card. I've had nothing but NVIDIA cards before this for my own computers, have had Radeons in other systems, and every Radeon card I have had continuous problems with, every NVIDIA has been without fault thus far.

-It rarely gets very loud even when gaming.Cons: -Like another reviewer stated, the ""Gigabyte"" RGB logo died on me not long after I got the card. Just one day it didn't work. Only reason it's not getting a 5.Overall Review: I would highly recommend this card. It performs and at a great cost while staying quiet and cool.

$409.99,Really good 3rd party 5700 xt version,rating rating-4,2019-11-14,11/14/2019 8:08:41 PM,"Pros: The 5700 xt is great, and if you watch the Gamers Nexus reviews you'll see the cooling solution on this card is one of the better ones. When I play older games the fans don't spin due to the low load and fan curve, so its nice and quiet. On a higher load it is still quieter than my cpu fan.Cons: The ""Gigabyte"" rgb led on my card died after about 3 weeks after I got it. The card still works great, just kind of a bummer. This is the only reason I'd take off an egg.Overall Review: I'd totally still buy this again, it sits at a great performance-price point.",Christopher H.
$409.99,Powerful Power Hungry Card,rating rating-5,2019-11-09,11/9/2019 12:01:18 PM,"Pros: - Fits in a ""normal"" 2-slot space
- Very powerful
- Good enough thermals for my ITX build
- Drivers maturing steadily
- AMD's wattman software offers great control - undervolting is literally the flick of a switch
- Decently quiet, even under loadCons: - Power hungry: spikes to 350W+ during intense renders
- Some stability issues, but this is mostly due to AMD's drivers still needing to mature
- Even with ""good enough"" thermals, it still runs very warm (~90C under load)
- Need to undervolt to achieve best temp to performance
- REQUIRES good ventilationOverall Review: TL;DR: Two most important things to gather from this review:

1. If you're having stability issues with this card, make sure that it's getting enough power by plugging the 6-pin and 8-pin connectors in to different lines from the power supply, rather than daisy-chaining from the same one (especially if you have a <700W PSU).

2. If you're having trouble with thermals on the card, make sure that the air can exhaust from the heatsink properly, and try undervolting it from AMD's wattman interface.

3. If you're still having problems, make sure you don't have CCleaner installed. Somehow, that program made this GPU fail.

---

I initially purchased this card back in August, 2019, when it was still brand new. I knew I wanted Navi since the rumors of it using the 7nm process began to circulate in early 2017, and the synthetic benchmarks from reviewers suggested that it would meet my hopes: AMD finally having an answer to Nvidia's years-long GPU dominance. My build had shifted a bit since the last AMD card I had, though; I went from a high-airflow ATX full-tower to an ITX shoebox; cooling, airflow, and space all require a bit more consideration.

When I first got the card, we had...issues. The card ran 15C warmer than I was seeing in reviews from GN and the like, and it was crashing extremely frequently. Upgrading the drivers in the rest of my system helped some, but ultimately, it felt like I might have gotten a bad egg. At least one BSOD a day told me that _something_ was wrong, but the symptoms were ambiguous and inconsistent.

I spent awhile focusing on the thermals, thinking that the warmth in the card was probably to blame. The card's cooler is built in such a way that the air exhausts out the sides, so I had to tune the fans in my case to account for the extra heat buildup. Even then, though, the thermals didn't come fully in line until I applied the auto-undervolt setting in AMD's wattman.

But even with the thermals fixed, I was still crashing.

That's when I found a forum post where someone else was having similar issues on an RX 590--and what resolved it was plugging the card in to two separate lines from the power supply. As it turns out, the power supply wasn't capable of delivering enough power over a single line to cover the spikes in power demand, and the card isn't built in such a way as to properly handle not having a glut of power available. Now that I've corrected this, and have each connector on a separate line, the GPU is substantially more stable--and runs MUCH better. These are the numbers I was expecting, and I'm glad to finally be getting them. Hat's off to AMD on making such an impressive entry to the mid-range market, and to Gigabyte for bringing such a great cooling solution to market, as well.

I'm sincerely hoping that AMD corrects this issue as they iterate on the Navi architecture and move beyond it. Spiking to 350W of power draw does not seem normal for a mid-range GPU, and while drivers and firmware updates may help to improve this, it feels like something that system builders shouldn't have to account for.",Joshua C.
$409.99,Good value at this time.,rating rating-5,2019-11-08,11/8/2019 9:11:16 AM,"Pros: Good build quality.
Good performance.
Neutral color scheme.
Not overly large.Cons: Drivers are much better than at launch, but there can still be a small bug every now and again.Overall Review: I got this to replace a Strix Vega 64 due to how hot and loud it was. This card has a small, but noticeable increase in performance at 3440x1440. It is much quieter and cooler than my Vega. It's hard to hear it over my case fans, which are also running slower due to less heat being dumped inside my case (Crystal 570). CPU is running cooler now too (3700x). I'm very happy with the purchase. It's a large quality-of-life improvement over the old Vega, that I payed significantly more for during the mining boom.",Douglas W.

Well built and attractive case.
Power LEDs help communicate power issues.
Adequate connectivityCons: Model is prone to issues.
Overly long requiring a GPU brace.Overall Review: A few of my neighbors, friends, and relatives have Strix cards and only one had issues. I settled on this instead of a FTW as ASUS is one of the scant few partners I'd buy a flagship from, was cheaper, and had good reviews from people I know. My card had a bevy of issues.

I'd BSOD a few times.
GPU heat in a fully open case hit 90C a few times.
Had to manually set a fan curve as the fans did not act is any acceptable way, and GPU still was hitting low 80c of mild or average loads.
Screen would go black, distort, cut in and out among other issues.
Fans had a ridiculous level of coil whine at high levels.
Get so hot as to mess with the other components as I air cool.
Had issues with PSU cables staying in, as the +2 part of them had issues connecting.

I RMAd the card, and Newegg took good care of me (Props to Newegg). They did not have another Strix, so I just got a refund. Bought the EVGA FTW and have not had one issue with it.
I'm more than willing to use Asus tech, have been for years and my new PC has a Asus Mobo. I've had Asus GPUs before and they worked like a charm. Now I get a card that was more or less hostile in its build. I would of given a better review if I had received a replacement to compare it. All I have is the one card I got and it was trash.

- Coil whine when gaming and does get annoying.
- High price point when there are still problems with the card (Bought it at $1650 and it has gone down by then)Overall Review: Buying lots of ASUS products I have seen their quality control, and for me it wasn't especially great. I have both a ASUS motherboard with 2 broken memory slots which i still haven't sent in for repairs since I have lost my CPU cover, and I possibly have to send this GPU in because of coil whine and fan vibrations. It is also made worse that they wont do any cross shipping.

I would hope that you get a higher quality product than I did if you plan on buying this card.

Excellent build quality with the brace adding significant structural integrity to such a fat card
Great looking aesthetic that plays very well with Asus' Aura software and with lights off is color neutralCons: Absurd price. But this is more an nvidia thing than Asus.

Extremely nice looking cardCons: New out of the box Fans are buzzing/rattling left one is the worst the middle one seems more random. its loud enough it can easily be heard with case fans on and side cover closed. I made video of it posted on Asus forum zero help from anyone. Coil whine just about as loud as the buzzing from the fans I could have lived with that but the fans are a deal breaker. (had zero coil whine from my Titan) When I removed the card to Rma I noticed manufacturer defects, every fan has individual blades with actual pieced missing from blades. I suspect that's the reason for the buzzing/rattle took pics posted on Asus forum also no replies. This part I was unlucky the card was a very poor over clocker in no way stable using the Nvidia scanner (auto over clocking tool). Newegg Rma process was great they made it super easy.

Radeon drivers come with a lot of tweaking available in software
Drivers have matured very well at this point.Cons: The card does get very warm so any large OC's maybe difficult.

$409.99,"Runs great for me, but not out of the box",rating rating-1,2020-05-07,5/7/2020 6:03:45 PM,"Pros: Great for 1080p on high+ settings
Good freesync, no tearing
Cost/ValueCons: Crashed often with out of the box settings (DCS and Boarderlands 3), It appeared the default fan curves were to low and the card would get hot during idle times as the fans were not spinning until some load was applied. Had to tweak fan curves to always keep the fans turning.Overall Review: I would recommend for anyone comfortable modifying fan curves, and tweaking OC-ing or undervolt-ing

I used manual tuning for volt settings and tweaked the fan curve in Adrenaline 2020 and have not had any bad luck with crashes after under-volting. In this case I used 1.027mV with max freq 1950mhz and clocked the vram to 1850mhz, I created a fan curve to run fans at 50% for temps under 60c and then increase as it gets hotter.

I traded a little performance for stability and chip life.

Update, after 4 months of use:
I wish i never went with this gpu and I should have went with similar nvidia.
I tried patiently to wait for driver updates since 19.8.2, now we are on 20.4.2 still unstable.
Black screens and hard resart, or Green screen and self reboot, or crashes stating error occurred in amdkdmap* or similar.
I have tried many things, updated the psu and even reinstalled windows.
Cant play games with any long missions knowing theres a high chance of crashing.
If I put my older nvidia 1060 card in my system I can play for hours with no issues, so its the gpu.
As a bonus, I found out the hard way it was not compatible with HP Reverb - screens would not power on, HP provided a firmware update due to how the AMD driver works, once again the HP Reverb worked fine with the older nvidia card but not the AMD. Now still having issue with the HP Reverb were AMD driver does not fill entire resolution of the display panels, so I have a VR device marketed for its high resolution but the AMD card cant feed it its native resolution, and again my 4yr old nvidia runs the HP Reverb fine full rez edge to edge.... facepalm.

$409.99,Pretty Good Job So Far,rating rating-4,2020-05-04,5/4/2020 9:38:21 PM,"Pros: -Unmatched performance for price
-Great for 1080p/1440p gaming
-Was concerned about cooling but seems to be holding at around 70C under loadCons: -A little unstable
-had to reinstall software/drivers, fixed errors and most crashing issuesOverall Review: Long story short, I really like this graphics card. I wouldn't recommend this card to everyone, I enjoy tinkering with overclocking and problem solving and I recognize this card wouldn't be a great choice for someone who just wants to plug in a card and have it work 100% out of the box. That being said if you can handle a little bit of instability the 5700 xt is a beast for the price point- NVIDIA doesn't have anything that matches it.
I'm running slightly OC'd at 2100 mhz as my card is unstable beyond 2120 and bringing it down a little more seemed to help with intermittent crashes. I haven't experimented with undervolting yet but I've heard good things so I mean to try it.
The initial install of the AMD Radeon software was throwing frequent AMDRSServ.exe error codes but reinstalling resolved this. Reinstalling drivers also seemed to help with crashes, not sure what went wrong with the first install.
In a mid-sized case with 5 fans (3 in, 2 out) seems to hold at around 70C under load with a side panel intake fan blowing almost right on it.. I know a lot of people have had problems managing heat but that hasn't been my experience.
Personally, I would buy this card again. Whether it's worthwhile for you would be dependent on whether you value stability or performance. For the same price you could pick up a 2060 Super for a perfectly stable plug and play graphics card, or you could go with the 5700 xt for more power at the cost of having to optimize it yourself a little bit and a crash here and there. It's also perfectly possible AMD will figure out their stability issues and this card will become the clear hands down winner for the price point. My bet's on AMD.

Update:
After owning this card for 3 months and tweaking its performance a lot more as well as applying the recent driver updates the card's stability has improved. I've stopped getting black screens and error messages while playing games since undervolting the card and applying the 2020 driver updates. Driver stability in general has improved, at least in my experience, and undervolting provides a couple fps performance loss for greater stability and even better thermals so I'm happy to do it.

Problems I still have with the card are when playing in modern games (specifically RE2 and 3 remakes) with Radeon Image Sharpening on, picking up an item (which automatically opens the menu) will sometimes crash the game. I've never had this problem with image sharpening off and it's listed in the known driver issues (as something along the lines of a ""task change"") so I'm confident this is the problem. The other problem is when playing graphically demanding modern games on one monitor (1440p) with another program such as chrome open on the secondary monitor (1080p) the game will sometimes crash or on rare occasion cause the computer to crash and restart. Issues with multi-monitor setups are also a known issue with current Radeon drivers.",Elyse B.

$409.99,Great Card for those who tinker!,rating rating-4,2020-04-30,4/30/2020 12:08:17 PM,"Pros: - Ridiculous performance. Stock outperforms the 2060 as expected. Mine scored in the upper percentiles of userbenchmarked 5700 XT's, and it destroyed 2060(S) by scoring 114%. OC pushes a bit more to about 117% and is line with a 2070, or a 2070S depending on the game.
- Sleek design, I paired it with a x570 Gaming X and the RGB Fusion 2.0 works like a charm. The RGB gigabyte logo is nice, the backplate is nothing special but a nice blank aesthetic. Material feels great.
- Stock temps are great, 70-85c under full load, Junction Temp hits 110c highest, which is within AMD spec.
- AMD OC puts this card from 2070MHZ. to 2130MHZ. Gives me about 5-15fps depending on the settings.
-1080p ultra on WWZ and Division 2 gets me easily 100+ FPS. Scored 11k on WWZ on stock. Can't remember Div 2.Cons: - Card can run hot if you OC it despite insanely good airflow. There may be thermal controlling issues with my card as any OC runs in the 80s really fast, at 46% fan speed.
- Fans can get LOUD. 50% fan speed has the fans going upwards of 3k+ RPM, and it is like you've got industrial fans in the computer. Not sure why even allow fans go that fast, and 3 of them at that. If you plan to OC, be prepared for a lot of tinkering and perhaps fixes to the card.
-Noticed some flickering here and there, and has some compatibility issues with some apps (Yi Home)Overall Review: Overall, really great card for the price. Beats a 2060S stock for stock, and I assume 2060S OC'd as well even on stock. Looks nice, and if OC'd is on par with a 2070 or a 2070S. No issues so far except for some momentary screen flickerings due to using OBS to record that only happen on boot of some games. Great card for someone who wants to plug and play. No driver issues.

However, if you're an enthusiast and bought this card to get the greatest bang for buck for OC, be prepared for lots of tinkering/troubleshooting. Thermals on OC take quite some time to get straight, and may require opening it up for thermal pad swapped or applying more pressure.

The first day I had this, I didn't realize I had to go into the software specifically to enable the fans to run, which imo should just be enabled out of the boxOverall Review: This doesn't feel like it's performing that much better than my last GPU (Nvidia 1050-ti) which is very disappointing. I was hoping to see a much steeper improvement, and while this can run better graphics settings, the stuttering and crashes aren't worth it. Card needs some major software overhauls and updates before this is worth your time. Look elsewhere for now.",Nathaniel S.

$409.99,Great Card - I have some issues though,rating rating-3,2020-02-28,2/28/2020 1:28:56 PM,"Pros: -Great graphics for gaming and streamingCons: -When the computer is woken up from sleeping/hibernating, the screen is solid red or solid blue (not the same thing as a blue screen of death)Overall Review: Before buying this card, I did research to see which of the 5700XTs had the best stock cooling. Gigabyte's card was one of the top listed cards along with the Sapphire Pulse. I went with Gigabyte due to the design.

Playing games it runs great and rarely ever does it have to rev up the fans to cool down the card. Then again I do not play for long periods and my computer case has three 140mm fans for intake and three for out.

Only problem I have run into with this card is when the computer falls asleep, the screen turns black as it should. If I wake up the computer right away the screen works fine. If I leave it asleep for about 5 min or more and try to wake up the computer, my screen wakes up most of the time with full red color or blue (not the same as Blue Screen of Death), it was green once. But the issue happens 100% of the time if left in sleep mode for more than 5min.

Have tried everything to fix this issue by:
-Re-seating the GPU
-Using different PCIe slot
-Unplugging and plugging cables back in
-Screen still comes up oddly colored after the computer boots back up
-Downgrading PCIe version to PCIe3 instead of default PCIe4
-A forum said incompatibility between motherboard X570 with older CPU 2700X
-Used different monitors
-Still the same color when swapped out during that state
-Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable
-Used different cables
-Still the same color when swapped out during that state
-Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable
-Updated Graphics Drivers
-Downgraded Graphics Drivers
-Updated W10 updates
-Update AMD CPU and Chipset with Catalyst

Nothing I have tried has fixed the issue. I don't know if its a faulty card or a known problem since I was able to find similar things on the internet.",Thien N.

- Runs decently cool for a high end card, especially in the 5700 series
- Gigabyte! One of my favorite third party card vendorsCons: - Very unstable
- Persistent driver issues 6+ months after release
- Will spend more time troubleshooting than playing some daysOverall Review: I upgraded to this card from an Rx 580 and I really wanted to stick with team AMD. AMD is killing it with their CPUs, but their GPUs are lagging and this card is a prime example. The price to performance on paper is killer, but that's just the hardware. The drivers are a broken mess that have not been fixed since release. I've tried every major release from 19.10.1 to the most current driver and each one pops up new issues with new fixes (turn off many extra features, only use one monitor, etc). When paying 400 for a graphics card one should not have to turn off many of the features of the software or not be able to use a muilti-monitor set-up.

A quick google of any 5700 driver errors will get you countless solutions, and believe me I've tried them all:
- New PSU (with a cable to each GPU power connector)
- Disable XMP
- Fresh install of Windows
- Undervolt / downclock

Even with all of those changes, still crashes constantly when gaming across multiple platforms. I really wanted to like this card and recommend it to people, but I just can't. The extra performance for the price isn't just worth it. At this point I wish I could return and go team green.",Jason v.

-With new or old drivers installed, and latest bios update, this thing would absolutely not run any games, would either crash immediately or after a few minutes.
- My monitor would not detect the card upon starting up the computer, had to reset up to 3 times before it would actually give me visuals.
- Flickering and red outline along edge of screen when the card actually (barely) worked. Stuttering was very prominent when it decided to function.

$409.99,Either got a faulty card or there are some real horrible driver problems that dont have a fix yet.,rating rating-2,2020-01-28,1/28/2020 10:58:31 AM,"Pros: Worked normally in some games.Cons: Stuttery mess in most games. Clock speed keeps fluctuating between 400Mhz and 1900Mhz causing massive stutters in most games.

Some games don't have the clock speed going higher than 900mhz leaving a really horrible experience where the fps keeps dropping below 144 fps all the way down to 60fps. It would get a maximum of 160 fps in games that are supposed to go up till 400 even.

CsGo is one of the examples. Literally lowest settings gives unplayable fps. Less than 60 fps and even that stutters. The weird thing is if i set settings to ultra it gives slightly more playable frames but still would drop to 80-90fps everytime i flick in CSGO.

I've tried tons of possible fixes (DDU, Fresh Windows install, etc), absolutely nothing works. There is a post on Amd's subreddits with 500+ Upvotes of people having the exact same problem from rx 5700xt, so its not that uncommon it seems.

The post describe issues on rx 5700xt of multiple brands not just gigabyte cards.Overall Review: Gave it a 2 star since it worked for some games as its supposed to like Witcher 3 and Forza Horizon 4.

But older games such as Witcher 2 and CSGO are just a mess.

Made me literally stop playing Apex Legends since its so stuttery that my gtx 1060 3gb would perform better.

Good cooling solution
Subtle RGB
Not a bad looking cardCons: Stock thermal pasteOverall Review: I have had this card since 1/9/20
I did my research and decided to go with this card because of the good cooling solution it had vs other 5700xt models out there, the three fans and heatsink do a great job keeping the card run cool.

Where the problem lies is in the use of the thermal paste, i'm not sure if its the cheapest stuff they could get to save money or the application method (thinking a combo of both) but when you start to push higher resolutions while gaming and maxing out what the card can do the temps will start to rise uncomfortably high. My temps on resident evil 2 remake at 1800p, locked 60fps and the highest of settings saw the cards junction temperature sitting around 105c, which was a bit to much for me.

I had a tube of Artic MX4 thermal paste lying around. I decided to open up the card and repaste. What i fount out by doing so was that they used very little thermal paste, the application was not that bad but they just did not use enough of it, even if they did use a little more i'm not sure how much it would of help cause i'm pretty sure they are using the cheapest stuff.

After i repasted with the MX4, under the same settings and resolution in resident evil 2 remake the card would hover around 85c for the junction temperature, i say that is a pretty significant improvement over the stock paste which goes to show just how bad the stuff they are using really is.

So overall this is a great card if you are interested in a 5700xt, just make sure you repaste with something that will actually do a better job at keeping the card cooler under full load like Artic MX4, Noctua H1, Thermal Grizzly etc..",David C.

$409.99,Extremely Powerful Card!,rating rating-5,2020-01-16,1/16/2020 4:13:15 PM,"Pros: I got this card about two weeks ago, and was incredibly excited as it is a massive upgrade from my old 1050ti. Setup was fairly easy, and getting it up and running only took about 30 minutes. Cranks frames on all of my games on high/ultra settings, and the Radeon Adrenalin Software 2020 provides a slick interface for monitoring performance! Never seen the GPU go above 70c, averages at about 65c while gaming. GPU Junction maxes out at 90c during furmark (extremely intensive GPU stress test). The design of the card itself is very nice and sleek, with minimal RGB on the gigabyte logo on the side of the card.Cons: It's well known that AMD is suffering from driver problems, and I did experience a few of those while gaming, especially while playing Modern Warfare on high settings (seems like a memory leak with high textures on). All other games seem to run with no problems at all. This card is also very power hungry, and lead to me needing a new power supply to run games without a reboot. Once I got a nicer power supply, this problem stopped (Corsair CX750m -> Seasonic Focus SSR-650).Overall Review: Would recommend this GPU if you aren't afraid of doing a little debugging! It's extremely powerful for the price, and will run every game I throw at it.",Cade R.

-Looks good
-Great performance
-User Friendly RGB Fusion 2.0 compatibilityCons: -Partial screen flashing/lines across the top corner of my monitor when using display port cable
-Only one HDMI portOverall Review: I was using a nvidia geforce gtx 1050ti before this card and wow is there a performance boost. Playing R6 Siege for example on ultra settings gets me about 180-250 fps on the rx 5700xt when I was getting about 100-120 fps on medium/low settings with my 1050ti. The card looks great as I have it synced with the rest of my rig with rgb fusion 2.0 and it couldn't be an easier install.

The one issue I have is that I use two monitors. The card has 3 Displayport and 1 HDMI slot. On my first monitor, I used the HDMI since it doesn't have a displayport slot. The second monitor, I have a displayport cable plugged into it since it does have the port for it. After Uninstalling all of the nvidia drivers and running ddu multiple times, I downloaded AMD's Radeon Adrenalin software and updated the drivers for the card to the most recent version as of 1/16/2020.

My monitor using HDMI has no issues with video output. The second one using displayport has very random flashing in the top right corner of the screen. It flashes and has lines and just glitches out randomly. I've tried Using a different displayport slot on the GPU and it doesn't change anything. I've also plugged the HDMI into this monitor and it works fine with HDMI.

I don't know if it is a driver issue or if there's something wrong with the brand new cable I bought for the card but I'd rather not have to buy a Displayport to DVI adapter. For now I'll live with the flashing since it's on my secondary monitor. Outside of the flashing, I love the card.",Gerrit T.

Pretty much all of my flatscreen games ran better on my old gigabyte 1060 3gb, so Im not really sure what to even say at this point, I just spent more money for less performance.
On top of the already low performance, all of my games stutter every 5 seconds or so (excluding vr once again)

$409.99,Don't waste the time or money,rating rating-1,2019-12-06,12/6/2019 1:37:46 PM,"Pros: noneCons: I bought two of these cards for two new builds and have had nothing but problems since day one. I had hoped with the online posted benchmarks, youtube reviews, etc that I had made a smart purchase. These were suppose to be fairly on par with the 2070 which was considerably more money. Both cards, in 2 separate computers, have problems with freezing in games, jittery motion, low frames, broken sound. In order to make the card function for even a short amount of time, I have had to go through and manually undervolt the cards, change settings that shouldn't have to be changed, and turn off certain features of games to keep from freezing. ALL of which should not have to be done on a brand new card. I've had nothing but NVIDIA cards before this for my own computers, have had Radeons in other systems, and every Radeon card I have had continuous problems with, every NVIDIA has been without fault thus far. Shame on me for trying Radeon.Overall Review: Don't waste your time or money, just save the extra money for an RTX 2070.",Jaynaleigh J.

When I play older games the fans don't spin due to the low load and fan curve, so its nice and quiet. On a higher load it is still quieter than my cpu fan.Cons: The ""Gigabyte"" rgb led on my card died after about 3 weeks after I got it. The card still works great, just kind of a bummer.

$409.99,Powerful Power Hungry Card,rating rating-5,2019-11-09,11/9/2019 12:01:18 PM,"Pros: - Fits in a ""normal"" 2-slot space
- Very powerful
- Good enough thermals for my ITX build
- Drivers maturing steadily
- AMD's wattman software offers great control - undervolting is literally the flick of a switch
- Decently quiet, even under loadCons: - Power hungry: spikes to 350W+ during intense renders
- Some stability issues, but this is mostly due to AMD's drivers still needing to mature
- Even with ""good enough"" thermals, it still runs very warm (~90C under load)
- Need to undervolt to achieve best temp to performance
- REQUIRES good ventilationOverall Review: TL;DR: Two most important things to gather from this review:

1. If you're having stability issues with this card, make sure that it's getting enough power by plugging the 6-pin and 8-pin connectors in to different lines from the power supply, rather than daisy-chaining from the same one (especially if you have a <700W PSU).

2. If you're having trouble with thermals on the card, make sure that the air can exhaust from the heatsink properly, and try undervolting it from AMD's wattman interface.

3. If you're still having problems, make sure you don't have CCleaner installed. Somehow, that program made this GPU fail.

---

I initially purchased this card back in August, 2019, when it was still brand new. I knew I wanted Navi since the rumors of it using the 7nm process began to circulate in early 2017, and the synthetic benchmarks from reviewers suggested that it would meet my hopes: AMD finally having an answer to Nvidia's years-long GPU dominance. My build had shifted a bit since the last AMD card I had, though; I went from a high-airflow ATX full-tower to an ITX shoebox; cooling, airflow, and space all require a bit more consideration.

When I first got the card, we had...issues. The card ran 15C warmer than I was seeing in reviews from GN and the like, and it was crashing extremely frequently. Upgrading the drivers in the rest of my system helped some, but ultimately, it felt like I might have gotten a bad egg. At least one BSOD a day told me that _something_ was wrong, but the symptoms were ambiguous and inconsistent.

I spent awhile focusing on the thermals, thinking that the warmth in the card was probably to blame. The card's cooler is built in such a way that the air exhausts out the sides, so I had to tune the fans in my case to account for the extra heat buildup. Even then, though, the thermals didn't come fully in line until I applied the auto-undervolt setting in AMD's wattman.

But even with the thermals fixed, I was still crashing.

That's when I found a forum post where someone else was having similar issues on an RX 590--and what resolved it was plugging the card in to two separate lines from the power supply. As it turns out, the power supply wasn't capable of delivering enough power over a single line to cover the spikes in power demand, and the card isn't built in such a way as to properly handle not having a glut of power available. Now that I've corrected this, and have each connector on a separate line, the GPU is substantially more stable--and runs MUCH better. These are the numbers I was expecting, and I'm glad to finally be getting them. Hat's off to AMD on making such an impressive entry to the mid-range market, and to Gigabyte for bringing such a great cooling solution to market, as well.

I'm sincerely hoping that AMD corrects this issue as they iterate on the Navi architecture and move beyond it. Spiking to 350W of power draw does not seem normal for a mid-range GPU, and while drivers and firmware updates may help to improve this, it feels like something that system builders shouldn't have to account for.",Joshua C.

Good performance.
Neutral color scheme.
Not overly large.Cons: Drivers are much better than at launch, but there can still be a small bug every now and again.Overall Review: I got this to replace a Strix Vega 64 due to how hot and loud it was. This card has a small, but noticeable increase in performance at 3440x1440. It is much quieter and cooler than my Vega. It's hard to hear it over my case fans, which are also running slower due to less heat being dumped inside my case (Crystal 570). CPU is running cooler now too (3700x). I'm very happy with the purchase. It's a large quality-of-life improvement over the old Vega, that I payed significantly more for during the mining boom.",Douglas W.

-RGB is a nice touch
-EVGA is usually a trustworthy company that seem to be willing to take this card back if I send it in. (which I will, and update my review from then)
-Runs high performing games around 60c in my setup (if i have fans on auto), Idle around 36c (in a 21c room)Cons: -I personally am getting a lot of coil whine and fan start-up noise coming from the card.
-From playing CSGO at medium settings is when the coil whine starts to get really irritating and escalates from there to COD: MW or Metro Exodus at high settings in which it is unbearable, especially if you don't have noise canceling headphones.
-I set the fans to run about 70-80% during high demanding games just to override the varied coil whine noises.
-Playing a low demanding game like hearthstone has become annoying as the fans start up and stop every 5 seconds on auto mode and the noise is quite annoying.Overall Review: -Great if you don't mind noise",Mark R.

I have upgraded my PCs for this purpose over the years. I currently have 6 GTX 1060s, 1 GTX 1660 and this RTX 2060 between 3 ROG PCs, 2 with AMD and i with I7 processor. Credit wise, on my chosen project, the GTX 1060 base does good. The GTX 1660 does about twice as good. This RTX 2060 does 4x as good as the GTX 1060!Cons: Generates a lot of heat when fully engaged, which BOINC projects typically do. Some heat to the front of the card is blown upwards through a perforated vent over the heat sink front up/card back. This, unfortunately, puts heat in front of the CPU cooler. Added heat shield (well piece of tissue box cardboard) to direct heat to side of case. Turned fans blowing air in on sides to pull air out. Problem solved.Overall Review: Keeping an eye on pricing and my budget to decide when another RTX 2060 goes in a box for me! If I ever take a fancy to gaming, I'll be super set!",Randy E.

I don't regret the price though. I really can't say much about it's true gaming capabilities since I use it for Prepar3d 4.5, but my frames in that went from 33 fps to 60 fps using a dual 27"" monitor setup, with the cockpit on one and an external view on the other, flying the PMDG 747-8.

Don't even dream about overclocking this card because temps will instantly hit 110C. I wouldn't mind running it stock, which I did. The problem lies in the quality of the card. Strix is supposed to be the flagship product line. The first card had flickering problems and was returned. The second was okay, until it developed a black screen issue, and was returned for another card through ASUS RMA. This new card ran hotter than the last one at stock settings, and was okay until it just died. No signal and boot loops the system.

This time, I cannot RMA the card because the serial number is not valid. I have reached out to ASUS through email since live chat is shut down (presumably from Coronavirus).

- handles 3 4K displays beautifully
- pairs well with my ROG motherboardCons: - it runs fairly warmOverall Review: I originally had an RTX 2080 Ti in my primary development system. It was struggling to drive the 4K displays for regular desktop usage in Linux (worked great in Windows, obviously). I don't play many games on my development system, so I decided to move the 2080 to my dedicated gaming box and try this card out. Originally I had intended to try a different nvidia GPU, but I decided to give this a shot instead.

I am constantly blown away by how much better this card handles my regular desktop usage in Linux. I never expected a cheaper card to be able to drive my displays better than a 2080, let alone a radeon (bad experiences in the past). This card also does very well with a lot of the games I've tried, even at 4K.

Haven't seen it go above 73C yet.Cons: After initial installation, everything worked beautifully. Excellent FPS, rock solid stability, all great. THEN I set up my Oculus Rift and everything made a turn for the worse.

I upgraded from an FX-9590 & R9 390X to a system with this GPU and a Ryzen 3950X. I was running three monitors and my Oculus on the old setup without issue. The three monitors worked fine on this card, but when I launched the Oculus software, I got terrible constant flickering across all the monitors. Every time I closed the Oculus software, the machine would lock up. I disconnected one monitor and everything worked fine. I ended up having to pair this card with an R7 370 to run my second and third monitors, with the primary display and the Oculus Rift connected to the 5700.

Mileage may vary, but that was my solution. Fortunately I had the R7 370 laying around to use.Overall Review: Excellent card, very potent. Runs great, but if you're running 4 displays, you might run into weirdness.

Runs cool.
Getting over 60 FPS on my LG 27GL83A-B 27 Inch Ultragear QHD IPS 1ms Monitor.
Dual bios. But don’t really care if it runs quiter in efficiency mode since I’m blasting explosions and gunfire over it with my headphones.
Don’t care about pretty lights. I’m not a kid.
Freaking HUGE card. Fits nice in my HUGE case.Cons: From AMD’s website: Some Radeon RX 5700 series graphics users may intermittently experience a black screen while gaming or on desktop. A potential temporary workaround is disabling hardware acceleration in applications running in the background such as web browsers or Discord

This has been an issue since Oct 2019. However, I did try the 19.12.1 drivers last night. I used DDU to remove the newest driver. I installed the 19.12.1 without the GUI. Played BF5 for about 2-3
hrs with no black screen. Let’s hope this will last. And Lets hope this helps others because we know AMD sure won’t.Overall Review: I would not recommend buying the card since AMD has taken no urgency in correcting their problems in providing a current working driver to their customers. It’s a shame they spend more time making a new, cluttered ,over stuffed, and impractical GUI and not focusing on their drivers. Their entire quality control dept seems inept as well.

AMD also thinks it’s funny not admitting it is a driver problem to all the customers who owns this card. Just search “RX 5700 XT black screen”. So many people are trying all these fixes and wasting time. They’re doing clean installs, buying new PSU’s. Messing with BIOS. Throttling back settings from default....list goes on...all while AMD sits back and laughs with their cruel joke of no disclosure. I will definitely go to the green side after this nightmare of a purchase.

Lastly. If I get a manufacturer response after this post please don’t read it. They don’t deserve anybody reading comments that helps defend themselves since it’s too late and you had your chance. See ya on the green side !",Scott B.

Poor factory quality control (See overall review)Overall Review: This could have been the best 5700XT of them all, but.....

As others have mentioned, the two screws adjacent the VRM are too long. This makes for poor or no contact with the heat sink. I replaced mine with two slightly shorter M.2 size screws I had laying around from an old laptop. There is also insufficient mounting pressure on the GPU itself. I added nylon washers to those 4 screws and my temps are insanely low for an XT. A very simple fix, just don't use excessive torque.

I have this paired with a Ryzen 2700X on a Strix X470-F and it's by far the fastest system I have ever used/owned. This card is HUGE. I have 1/2 inch clearance between it and my middle front case fan in a Corsair 220T RGB Airflow.

Yes, you need to RMA or switch the backplate screws (takes 30 seconds to do). If you enable auto fan profile and auto undervolt in AMD Wattman, the contant low fan speed at idle keeps the idle temps at 40C, and gaming at 60-80C which is exceptional for a 5700 XT, which typically runs hot out of the box.

1440p ultra settings sits around 80-90 FPS in games like the Witcher 3 and Borderland 3 with only a r2600 cpu but for some reason it’s better to cap FPS with this card as it reduces crashing and lock ups that I’m assuming are because of Radeon boost.
Quality PCB
And
Uhh
Ummm it looks pretty!Cons: Ok here we go.
As for the cons, I didn’t get a over clocker so that’s a bummer but with 92c junction temp at stock clocks It might still be with a water block.
THE ADRENALINE SOFTWARE
It deserves caps trust me, the adrenaline 2020 software is hilarious to say the least, it goes from 900 degrees C junction temp to running whatever fan curve it wants after a hard restart so just keep the fan curves and temperature read outs to MSI afterburner or something better.Overall Review: I would recommend this card to someone who is not a first time PC user as it’s a finicky card and has much more finicky software too boot, even though I heard that a lot of improvements are coming to adrenaline 2020 this 2020 it’s just not there yet for me to recommend to a everyday user. All that being said the money you save compared to the 2070 super for around the same performance other than ray tracing is justifiable.",Catherine H.
$459.99,Has some build quality issues...,rating rating-3,2020-01-11,1/11/2020 11:51:27 AM,"Pros: I like that the card is quite a bit faster than my older RX 480 4gb...Cons: During the build process, they designate 2-4 screws that go down through the back plate to the PCB and attach it to the cooling system. They used screws that are probably 2x too long and allow for the cooling system to lose contact with the PCB components it is trying to cool. You can jimmy rig it to make it work correctly by changing out a few of the screws used solely for attaching the back plate to the PCB and using them for the ones that attach the PCB to the cooling system. It is somewhat of a hack job, but it does sort out the cooling issues.Overall Review: Just wish they wouldn't have skipped that process of making sure that the cooling system was properly attached and working correctly.. instead of shipping out faulty issues labeled as in pristine working condition.",James G.

It's humongous, if that mattersOverall Review: This is my first new GPU in several years, my most recent was a EVGA GTX 780 OC. This absolutely obliterates it which is no surprise to anyone. And I thought that card was big. This one is even bigger. I wasn't expecting that.

Having owned quite a few graphics cards, going all the way back to the Voodoo2, this is so far the least buggy/most stable. I haven't had to tweak or adjust anything since installing, I think this is the first card ever to work this perfectly with so little work.

And it goes without saying that it performs wonderfully. I assume a 2080 Ti performs even better but IMO you're reaching the point of diminishing returns spending that much on a card when there's options like this out there. The purchase included a copy of Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and with everything set to ultra at 1080p it usually runs up in the 90+ FPS range which is insane given the detail in that game. Slightly older games like Doom 2016, it will max out my 144hz monitor.",Aaron C.

Temps playing are 60 to 70 c, drawing 190 to 200 watts.Cons: I expected more quality for the money spent. The last four screws holding the backplate through the heatsink were switched resulting in very little vrm & memory contact. Easy fix simply switch them around an tighten snug. Temps went from high 80's to high 50's on vrm & memory under load with the switch of the screws. Unloaded on desktop out of the box card @ IDLE high 60""s temps. Unacceptable ASUS!!! Downloaded and flashed new bios from ASUS helped a little on power tables and temps. Set a custom fan curve, undervolted, and tweaked all the other pc fan curves to compliment each other. Now @ idle mid 40""s, gaming @ high 60' low 70's. Last item I had to tweak was @ idle memory clock was maxing out, not a ASUS problem though, tweaked my 144hz monitor with Cru and memory clock now cycles down on desktop.Overall Review: I still have an ASUS P-4 800c Deluxe running for retro gaming.

$459.99,Initial Review,rating rating-4,2019-12-26,12/26/2019 5:55:29 AM,"Pros: Fast. Easy install/setupCons: SizeOverall Review: This is a big card. It's loud, but it does what it says on the box. I really don't care about the noise, I like performance. Too many poor reviews based on noise alone - really, get a grip folks. This card is fast, it benchmarks well and in terms of frame rates is right up there with the 2070. I was always an Nvidia fan, but after getting the R9 390 and seeing the performance vs price difference, am firmly in the red corner for a while.
I did not have any issues with drivers or setup, though I did undervolt it as many recommend. I don't play a lot of games, but I do use an oculus rift. Arma 3 on ultra is kicking out 240+ fps. Xplane 11 is around 30fps due to the OpenGL platform, but it works well enough that it's not choppy, and has decent level of world objects and HDR.
All my other VR titles are smooth as can be on max settings.
It runs around 65C under Max load in my system, I did notice that my system fans are working harder to expel more heat, but that's as designed so no complaints so far.

Had the exact same issues the reviewer below me had so I will quote them where I can. ""Quote"" - ""Upon opening package and inspecting the graphics card itself, found the cooler not properly mounted (loose in mutliple areas} and could visually see that thermal pads were not making full contact in certain sections (specifically in the VRM and Memory sections close to the 2 8 pin power plug sockets) . Installed graphics card anyways and this is where the nightmare began...

Due to the card sitting horizontally when installed and a loose heatsink,gravity and the weight of the card causes the thermal pads to separate from the heatsink and from the memory chips and from the VRM Mosfets causing the entire card to overheat and BSOD my system!!
The card caused major instability with the system due to these issues, causing crashing upon powering on the system, loading Windows 10, loading games, movies,apps you name it. Mind you i have all new drivers freshly installed and also updated the BIOS with Asus's newest ECO mode [was told to do so after multiple emails to Asus Support directly]
I even provided a youtube video showing said faults in the mounting of the heatsink from there factory and there reply was "" We dont know of such defects and they are not an issue!!""

Long story short I also returned my faulty graphics card and will be purchasing a card from Nvidia and a competing brand this time around. I in no way shape or form recommend this graphics card or brand as they provide bad products and then when you ask for help from them they shoot you down and try to discredit you for speaking out against there shotty manufacturing.

-Core clock can just drop out if looking speed is too fast, and has dropped below 100mhz and lower on occasions

-PC will crash while gamingOverall Review: **EDIT 12/18/19**
I wanted the 5700xt very badly and wanted the ROG Strix because how much I loved my Strix 1070. Since changing over it has been one thing after another, and I cannot figure it out. I maintained core clock speeds perfectly on the old 1070, but this thing is all over the place. It maxes out the VRAM while the core clock hovers between **700-800mhz** just running in Apex. If in a fire fight and swiveling very fast, the frame rates drop significantly, screen delays but no artifacting, and then the PC crashes. I can provide screenshots and data logs, but no option to attach pictures. On my 1070 I could set a core clock, and it maintained that clock speed while gaming. I cannot deal with these clock speeds dropping hard, boosting back up, and then dropping again. PC Specs: R7 3700x, Asus Prime Pro x570, Corsair 2x8gb 3600mhz, and all latest BIOS/drivers installed. The worst part is I cannot get a full refund to go back to Nvidia. So disappointed because I had such high hopes for this card.

I tried booting into safe mode and uninstalling the gpu drivers (which the system would no longer lock up if i had no driver installed) i did some research and an AMD BIOS update activated PCIE 4.0 on 400 chipset boards. (i am running B450) I booted into the UEFI and found the location of the settings for the PCIE slots and found that they are set to ""auto"". AMD has been marketing these NAVI cards as PCIE 4.0 ready so i am assuming when you install a PCIE 4.0 card (5700 XT) into a PCIE 4.0 motherboard (400 and 500 series) they freak out .

make sure to: use two separate 8-pin connectors from your power supply
have at least a 600 watt power supply (I've seen this thing suck up to 252 at one point so overclocking will need a high watt count)

$459.99,One of the best Graphics Cards I've ever had.,rating rating-5,2019-10-30,10/30/2019 3:20:49 PM,"Pros: Everything so far has been a pro for this card. I upgraded to this card from a Sapphire Radeon R9 Fury X, that was still good for gaming; however I could never max out my games because I needed at least 5 GB of VRAM to do it. I had my sights set on this card ever since I had heard about it from the YouTube tech community.

It was easy to install and ran perfect right out of the box. The fans are not loud at all even on load (at least in my system.) I'm getting a lot more FPS than I did with my old card; however, it still works. The RGB is cool. The temperature stays around the 60's while gaming. The 8 GB of VRAM is more than enough for any gamer, at least right now. It works for me and I hope it works for anybody else who buys it.Cons: None, so far.Overall Review: Again, this is an awesome card and I would recommend it for anybody. However, there are other nice cards out there and it's your decision to make which one to buy. Although, before buying any AMD card I would wait a few months before buying so that they can iron out the bugs in the Radeon software and drivers. Buy with confidence.",TIMOTHY C.

$459.99,Probably the best RX 5700 XT,rating rating-5,2019-10-08,10/8/2019 12:14:02 PM,"Pros: - Large heatsink and 3 fan combination
- RGB lighting, including colour gradients for temperature monitoring
- Stable with AMD 19.9.3 Drivers
- Quiet Fans even at higher RPMs
- Memory easily OC'd to 900-950MhzCons: - Requires some adjustments within AMD's GlobalWattman to maximize performance
- Can including lowering the clock speed/voltage, with little performance impactOverall Review: While there have been a fair number of reviews of the competing AIB, not so many for the ASUS Strix version, which is unfortunate as it appears to be the best of the batch. I also own the Sapphire Nitro+ RX 5700 XT in a separate build and while it is also a solid performer the extra nudge goes to Asus in my opinion. This card is built extremely well and includes dual bios, RGB led off switch on the card and 2 PWM fan slots. It is also the quietest card I've ever owned, period with temps below 75C under load. If you are considering the RX 5700 XT, this card is at a premium however, it is the one to get if you don't want to be dealing with overheating issues, etc...",Anthony G.

$459.99,Excellent performance!,rating rating-5,2019-10-03,10/3/2019 9:17:31 PM,"Pros: Build quality is excellent. Built in support structure make the card more rigid that previous Strix cards. Doesn't seem to sag. Dual Bios, out of box overclock, overall performance. Replaced a Strix Vega 56 I had for 6 months with this. Roughly 20% performance gain across the board. Paired with a LG 144 hz ultrawide 2560 x 1080 monitor for now. Extremely smooth - high frame rates in most titles.Cons: Prices are a bit high for all of these cards! (5700's, 2060's) This performance range was almost HALF of these prices just 2 - 3 years ago!Overall Review: My previous graphics cards (Arez Strix Vega 56, Strix RX 480/580 OC) are still being used in my household, and still play most titles very well. AMD finally seems to have an architecture that they can scale well. The performance uplift is much more eye-popping than it was going from the 580 to the Vega.
I just recently sold a R9 380(XFX) and I still have a R9 290(ASUS). I fully expect to have this card as long as I have had the 290 (2014). I would definitely recommend this card over the RTX competition. More performance for the money, AMD chips are generally supported much longer, and in my option, the picture quality has been noticeably better going back to ATI days.

This card feels solid, and is a bit heavy. The RGB lighting effects are awesome and lots of customization via the Asus software. And performance wise, it plays everything I have thrown at it. I believe this card is well worth the extra cost over some other 5700xt. Card also runs nice and cool under load. Has switch on card to switch from performance mode or quite mode. The led on/off button on card is a nice feature as well.Cons: NoneOverall Review: I can tell you, you will not be disappointed. Just keep in mind this card is longer than a standard card, so make sure it fits in your case. It simply looks and feels like another well thought out product from Asus product line.

-Overclocks over 2ghz pretty easy if you want
-Never exceeded 74°CCons: -Enormous. Plan your case accordingly it is a 2.75 slot card and almost 14"" long
-Loud. It will run no fans up to 60° or so but as it gets 70° it will kick the fans into this ear splitting harrier jet until it goes below 70°. Some less demanding games this can cause a perpetual revving up and down. Custom fan curves won't stop this.
-Coil whine under load.Overall Review: -would I recommend this card? No, I feel like you could get similar power without it being so noisy. The third fan, the smaller of the three, seems to be the culprit and doesn't follow any kind of fan curve you set. I think it might have its own fan controller separate from the big two.

- Good cooling

- Noise is reasonableCons: - Ridiculous price.
- This card is huge. May not fit in some cases.Overall Review: This GPU is fantastic. There's no better feeling than opening a new triple A game and cranking every setting to max at 1440p and still getting well over 100 fps. The looks are not bad, and the cooling is above average compared to other 2080 ti's. The fan noise is not bad at all. The fans idle when not under load, making it silent during web browsing, video streaming, etc., and are a very reasonable, non obtrusive volume when under load.

Unfortunately, it takes ends up 4 slots once you account for the much needed (and provided!) support bracket. And, as everyone else is pointing out, the price hurts. That being said, if you're looking for a GPU that doesn't compromise ANY performance, this is the card for you.",Brian W.
"$1,234.00","Big and fast card, when it wants to work that is.",rating rating-1,2019-09-28,9/28/2019 6:43:21 PM,"Pros: Large heatsink and triple fan setup dissipates heat effectively; especially with bottom air intake pushing air directly into the fans.

Includes a steel PCI-E support bracket that screws into the expansion slots under the GPU to assist in combating GPU sagging; this card is a beast, big and heavy.

2x8-pin and 1x6-pin PCI-E power connectors so card always has plenty of that sweet PSU juice to drink up.

Nifty and bright looking rainbow RGB effects if you're into that kind of thing.Cons: Constantly crashes, losing video signal and ramps the three fans up to 100% speed. Happens completely randomly. You could be gaming, stress testing, creating, watching Youtube or simply sitting idle doing nothing; might last you 4-5 hours, might not last you 5 minutes until it crashes. Even sometimes crashes before the MOBO is able to successfully boot into windows. Doesn't matter the current load or temperature. Never even bothered OCing due to the card constantly crashing. Colossal disappointment. Transplanting the card into my other systems sitting around the house resulted in the same pattern of random crashing. Tried installing previous driver versions hoping it would just be simple driver issues that could be easily fixed with rollbacks but the crashing persisted regardless of the version of drivers I installed from Nvidia.

Large and heavy, using the included support bracket is almost necessary but unfortunately takes up an additional 2 expansion slots directly under the card, so I wouldn't recommend it for systems built for SLI/NVLink or systems running additional add-on cards. Card is also very long and on my ASRock Z390 Extreme4 covers up 6 of the 8 SATA connectors on the MOBO; so make sure you attach your necessary cables before installing the GPU.Overall Review: Brand new system build. System works with every other GPU I've had sitting around my house; GTX1080, wife's GTX1050Ti and even my old GTX980. Had to switch back to my GTX1080 so I'd at least be able to use all the new hardware I purchased. Since swapping back in my older GTX1080 I've not had a single crash.

The fellow on the other end of the phone tried to tell me the card didn't ship with a driver disk, yet clearly the inventory sheet inside the packaging indicates there IS a driver disk. He went to check, then came back and told me yes, he could ship me a driver disk but I would have to pay $10.00 for shipping. I told him I don't buy a $1,300+ GPU and then pay an extra $10.00 for the driver disk that should have shipped with the product in the first place!

"$1,234.00",Approximately been 4 months of use... still going strong!,rating rating-5,2019-03-20,3/20/2019 9:22:17 AM,"Pros: -
*It still hasn't died yet. Seriously though, that's one of my biggest concerns and I'm sure of a lot of people when considering buying this GPU. So much reports out there of these 2080Tis dying. I'm happy to say that mine hasn't and haven't shown any of the reported space invaders error, artifacts, etc. In fact, the only crash I ever got is when I was OC'ing this GPU and was easily resolved by just lowering the OC.

*Despite having the dreaded Micron memory that a lot of people claims to be the culprit of these GPUs giving errors or dying, that hasn't happened to me. I was able to OC the memory to +800Mhz but it wasn't stable enough so I downclocked it +750 which it has been running all this time without giving me any problem. Even though the memory is Micron and not Samsung, I've read reports of people also with Samsung memories dying/crashing/etc. so its kind of hard to just blame it on the memory.

*I have upgraded from an Asus Strix 1080Ti OC Edition which I'm very impressed with and has served me good when I was gaming at 3440x1440p 100Hz (Acer Predator X34) on an ultrawide display but I have upgraded to a 4k 144Hz GSYNC HDR monitor (Acer Predator X27) which is the main reason I upgraded to a 2080Ti. It's hard to point it out but I can definitely feel a qualitative increase in my overall gaming experience after upgrading to a 2080Ti versus my 1080Ti. It's not so much on the FPS but the overall experience seems much smoother and more solid. Don't get me wrong, my 1080Ti is a beast too in performance but I feel its more rough around the edges and more prone to stuttering/micro-freezes compared to a 2080Ti... at least in my case.

*It can run almost every game at 4k @ 60fps (mostly higher but that depends on your setting). Almost every game I played I can run on Ultra or Maximum settings and still be about 100+ fps. This includes Resident Evil 2 Remake, Dead or Alive 6, Devil May Cry 5, Jump Force, etc. Metro Exodus on the other hand is around 60-80+fps on almost max settings. DLSS can boost the FPS but it seem to make things more blurry so I don't like using it on Metro Exodus. I've read they might have upgraded the DLSS implementation on this game to make it better but I have to check again.

*This GPU has very good build quality and feels very solid. In my opinion, this must be the 2nd best looking 2080Ti with RGB implementation...the first being Gigabyte Aorus 2080Ti Extreme with its dazzling spinning RGB fans. I was even thinking of getting the Aorus at first but the reviews shows it doesn't really do a good job on cooling the GPU. Another thing is for the RGB fans to look good, the fans has to be spinning at 60%+ RPM so if you have the setting where the fans don't spin if the temp is low enough, it will look like cr4p not being to show off its spinning RGB fans.

*My temps has been very decent. Max is around 72-75°C when I'm benchmarking/GPU torture test but around 62°C-70°C on normal gaming with an ambient temp of around 78°C in the room. These are temps inside a closed case. If I open it up, the temps will be much lower. I wish reviewers of GPUs will do more test using the GPU inside a case than on their open-case test bench with their AC in the room in full blast 'coz if not, their reviews on temp is pretty much useless to me. Oh btw, these temps are also using the default fan setting. When I tweaked the fan settings to run the fans at 40-60% RPM depending on the temp, the GPU never exceeded 70°C and was usually just around 60-64°C.. and at this fan setting, it was still pretty much silent.

*As as I said above, I have no problem with the fan noise. I left it at default even though it makes the GPU run a little bit warmer. I mean the max temp for this GPU is around 88°C and it has never ever reach that high even when I'm running loops of Furmark for hours on its default setting (highest was 75°C). For coil whine noise, I've never heard it at all during regular game play. During benchmarking though, if I put my ear close enough to the case and intentionally try to hear for it, I can hear a little bit. This is mostly during my Fire Strike & Time Spy benchmarking. This noise is very minimal and I have to deliberately get my ear close to the case to hear it. It's nothing like the high pitched coil whine of a PSU or those old AMD Radeon cards. It's more silent.Cons: -
*This GPU is freaking expensive! Like TITAN class expensive!! I own a lot of NVIDIA GPUs and some AMDs and I can't wait for Intel to enter the fray and make these GPU prices go down or maybe AMD's Navi would do some miracle and overthrow NVIDIA's top GPUs... but I doubt it. I'll go for whoever has the best price/performance on my next upgrade. I'm just kind of forced to go for the 2080Ti for now since its undoubtedly the best GPU at the moment (If you don't count RTX Titan) and 'coz I needed a 2080Ti to run my 4k 144Hz GSYNC HDR monitor.

*Like the previous reviewer down below me here in Newegg, I hope I don't jinx myself writing this review and make my MSI 2080Ti GAMING X TRIO die on me. Even though my GPU is still running great and I have no problems so far, its only been about 4 months after all. Some people here have reported theirs dying after 5 months. 0MG, I hope that doesn't happen to me. But we'll see... only time will tell. If that happens, you can be sure that I will update this review including how MSI support handling of the case... Hopefully though it doesn't come to that.

*This card is HUGE! Make sure your case can fit it in before you buy it. I have a Corsair 780T and it fits just fine. Also, this GPU uses two 8-pin and one 6-pin power connector. Make sure your PSU has the cables and voltage capacity to support it.

*This card will most likely require you also to use a support bracket. This package comes with one... use it! I used mine along with an MSI GPU bolster (Google it) and its just perfect. No sag at all with this set up.

*MSI didn't use more quality parts on this GPU compared to their upcoming ""Lightning"" 2080Ti. Aside from the extra 6-pin power connector which is pretty much useless 'coz of the power limit, every other part used seems to have been stock. For the same price point, Asus and Gigabyte claims to use more quality components.Overall Review: -
I been holding of on writing this review for a while now. I want to make sure I possibly done all I can to make sure I didn't get a defective one that will give me those notorious space invaders errors then die. I have put this card on several GPU torture tests in loops. I've been running this GPU OC'ed all this time (+110 OC, +750 mem) up to writing this review and so on. It hasn't given me any indication of dying so far. My PC system is running very stable overall... then again, I do take good care of the software part aside from the hardware. I make sure my drivers are always updated and no conflicts, OS updates installed, HDDs not overheating and no SMART errors, and the occasional cleaning of temp and trash files that the system will no longer use. I also run defrag on my HDDs... yes it does help.

-
MSI, at this price point, I wish you guys have used more quality components on this GPU. There are no mention of your often claimed ""Military Grade"" components on this GPU at all while Asus and Gigabyte claims they used better components than the stock NVIDIA uses. Well I guess its all good as long as it doesn't die on me. But tell you what, I have an MSI motherboard die on me before.. and when that happened... I never touched another MSI product for 7 years. This GPU is the 1st MSI product I purchased after 7 years.. and I buy a lot of expensive hardware and write a lot of long honest reviews everywhere online and also talk about it a lot not only online but also with my co-workers and fellow tech enthusiast. If this MSI 2080Ti dies on me before the 3 year warranty and MSI doesn't handle it in a manner I'm satisfied with, you can bet I'll never touch another MSI product again for several years and will write a bunch of reviews online about it. Sorry but this is not a threat but a promise :)",Ranze P.
"$1,234.00",5 month mark.....,rating rating-5,2019-02-23,2/23/2019 6:52:41 AM,"Pros: Extremely fast. I am coming up on the 5 month mark on ownership on mine. It has the dreaded Micron GDDR5 that many suspected to be the cause of all these RTX failures. This card has been thoroughly abused with huge amounts of gaming, etc and it still runs like a champ, and overclocks well to boot.j

The large cooler does a decent job of cooling it. Fans are still reasonable at higher fan speeds.Cons: Card is large and has some noticeable sag in my case. I believe the 3 8 pin PSU connectors is overkill, especially when they don't give you near the Power Limit adjusting to go along with that.

Of course price is high for all these RTX 2080 (ti)sOverall Review: Man...I hope I don't jinx myself with leaving this review and my card has issues soon. So far so good. Very happy with RTX 2080 Ti performance.

Also I want to give a shout out to MSI RMA department. I recently had to send in an MSI GTX 1080 Ti Gaming X because one of the fans died on it, causing high temps. I shipped the card out to MSI on a Tuesday and received it back on the following Tuesday. Thoroughly impressed on the week turn around to get my card fixed and returned......",Jason L.
"$1,234.00",prefect if no coil whine sounds,rating rating-3,2019-01-18,1/18/2019 11:00:00 PM,"Pros: The RGB effect is amazing, it should be the one of the best RGB 20 series card.

The boost clock speed is one of the highest no FE card. Could easily achieve 4K 60 FPS amount most triple A title games at very high settings

The MSI afterburner gives easy control over the fan speed, auto overclocking (ctrl+f for the scan)

The thermal performance is also great, the fan rpm is about 41%~50% when playing high demanded game, the temperature never goes up to 74, and it’s still quieter than my Aio fans at 1300 rpm. (Sadly my card have coil whine sound even louder than the fan noise)Cons: This size of this card is also one of the largest 2080ti among the market, it come with a support, but it would take about 5~6 pcie slot. So would’t fit in small case or even some mid-tower case. But fit perfectly in my H700i

The most disappointed thing about this card is the coil whine sound. Ever high-end card could have that sound if the clock speed is high and fully loaded, but this one is just too loud to ignore it. Would help with the headphone, the high frequency coil whine sound made by capacitance could easily penetrate headphone. I’m not sure whether only my card is the defective one or it’s a design problem, but I have initiated the RMA for replace, hopefully it would work.Overall Review: Overall this card is really good. I love its design, performance, and RGB so much, but just can’t stand a over 1500$ card (with tax) have such annoying coil whine sounds.",Quancheng L.
"$1,234.00",Great card let down by unreliability,rating rating-2,2019-01-09,1/9/2019 8:31:01 PM,"Pros: 4K gaming at 60+ FPS on ultra settings for most games
120+ FPS for 1440p on ultra.
Beefy card, great cooling, looks fantastic, has RGB.

Really this card is fantastic... in all ways except where it really matters -- that is works reliably.Cons: This card lasted for about 5 weeks of use. Received on Nov 11 2018, went on vacation Dec 21. Came back Jan 8 to a card that started displaying ""space invader"" artifacts when playing games or running benchmarks. Even the Windows desktop started artifacting before I took the card out to RMA.Overall Review: I'd recommend this card in 6 months or so once they figure out their reliability issues. 5 weeks is a joke. For now save your money.",Matthew I.
"$1,234.00",Lasted 5 Weeks,rating rating-1,2019-01-08,1/8/2019 4:55:37 PM,"Pros: - Very fast, when it worked
- Ray tracing in Battlefield V is gorgeousCons: - It lasted about 5 weeks before producing a number of artifacts (wavy horizontal lines) when booting up in the BIOS phase, and in Windows. This occurred in two different system builds. After it began to produce problems, it would no longer output video to more than one display, and would not display video at resolutions higher than 1024 x 768.Overall Review: - I just recently initiated the RMA process, and hope that it will go smoothly, resulting in a working replacement.",Don H.
"$1,234.00",One of the best 2080 ti's out there,rating rating-5,2018-11-19,11/19/2018 8:28:51 PM,"Pros: RGB lighting, one of the only few cards that come with it built in.
Factory overclock is nice
Size and build quality are top notch. I guess what do you expect for a $1300+ gpu?Cons: price obviously
Size to some will matter- make sure it will fit your caseOverall Review: Upgraded from 1080 ti TRIO to 2080 ti TRIO.. so my review is a little biased.
Have had no issues with my 1080 ti TRIO so expecting the same with the 2080. Only time will tell",Eddie Y.
"$1,234.00",Just died in one week,rating rating-1,2018-11-13,11/13/2018 7:26:25 AM,"Pros: Absolutely a beautiful powerful beast, Its ability is worth the price for me.Cons: But it died in just few days after I install it. The screen goes messy and the resolution is locked. Disappointing for a such high end cart at such a high price.Overall Review: Guess go for the 2080tis is not the best choice for now. A lot of problems occur on various brands of cards",Wenhao S.
"$1,234.00",Worth the wait and weight?,rating rating-5,2018-11-09,11/9/2018 8:38:15 AM,"Pros: In my opinion this is the best 'out of box' 2080ti available. Some people love the looks while others hate it. I personally love it. The RGB lighting looks real nice and they don't really show it off enough in the stock product pictures.

Is this card worth it? well I jumped from a 1070 to this 2080ti and I could not be happier. If you are playing games at 1080p then definitely skip this card, its not for you. But anyone playing at 1440 or higher will love how this thing handles. I am currently on a ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q 1440p at 165hz. In CoD4 on my 1070 I was averaging about 70-80 fps. Now I am averaging 180 fps.

So far I don't have a reason to overclock but I know I will once more demanding titles show up (maybe once the ray tracing is finally turned on).Cons: -HEAVY! So heavy that if you stand your computer upright (which most non-serial killers do) you will need to use the supplied sag prevention bracket. This brings us to the second con...
-The sag prevention bracket is SO ugly. I hate that I have to use this thing in my rig but it is what it is.
-Requires 2x 8pin and 1x 6pin power connectors, make sure you have this ready before it shows up
-Also this card is YUUUUGE, make sure you have the room in your case.Overall Review: If you have the money, get this card. I set alerts on this card to notify me once its available but it usually sold out in just minutes. I used a site called nowinstock (google it), this sent me an alert via text message that was much faster than neweggs alert email.",Sven S.
"$1,234.00",Very Expensive RTX 20 Series Graphics Card with Unprecedented Performance!,rating rating-5,2018-10-04,10/4/2018 12:06:44 AM,"Pros: *Blazingly fast 11GB GDDR6 Video Memory
*Derived Turing GPU Architecture including RT Cores (Ray Tracing) and Tensor Cores (A.I. Neural Network for DLSS)
*Compatible with G-Sync Monitor
*Comes with 3x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x HDMI 2.0b, and USB Type-C (VirtualLink VR) Connection
*Engineered with Zero Frozr Aerodynamic Design to ensure fans, heatpipes, heatsink, and Thermal Compound X to keep GPU run cool while running low noise operation
*Mystic Light Sync Technology to synchronize & customize RGB profiles which also works with many vendors such as Razer, Corsair, Cooler Master, G.Skill, Silverstone, etc.
*Comes with three Torx Fans with Double Ball Bearing to ensure quiet noise level while maintaining air flow performance
*It includes NVLINK connector to support 2-Way SLI via AFR (Alternate Frame Rendering)
*Uses high quality premium backplate to protect its PCB
*For the accessories, it includes 6-pin & 8-pin power cable and Graphics Card Support BracketCons: *Unfortunately, you are paying premium; that's a fair warning. But still, you pay what you get for not only better performance, but also new technology such as RTX and DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)
*Requires at least 650 Watt Power Supply or greater, and you will also need 1x 6-pin & 2x 8-pin Power Connectors
*Physical Card Dimension is: 327 mm x 140 mm x 55.6 mm (12.87"" x 5.51"" x 2.19""). Make sure to double check your case manufacturer's specification to ensure that the graphics card will fit inside the case whether it's Mid Tower or Full Tower Chassis
*Limited RTX Games support
*Requires Windows 10 October Update Version 1809 including DXR API to benefit RTX feature.
*Requires decent CPU and faster RAM speed to prevent bottlenecking GPU
*Make sure to download latest and greatest GeForce Driver 411.70 or newer at GeForce WebsiteOverall Review: The RTX 2080 Ti is by far the fastest consumer graphics card in 2018. As you can see, it runs very quiet & fast, compared to GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti. In terms of gaming performance, I was running around 200fps+ in Call of Duty: WWII which felt very smooth, responsive, and fluid. Yes, I am using Acer Predator XB272 240Hz G-Sync Monitor. When it comes to overclocking, I personally like MSI Afterburner Overclocking Utility Software since it's very intuitive, simple & straightforward to overclock such as showing the graph of GPU utilization, CPU & GPU temperature, frame rate, frame time variance, core & memory clock speed, etc. Not to mention, you can also try NVIDIA OC Scanner which you will need to download MSI Afterburner 4.6.0 Beta 9 or newer. With NVIDIA OC Scanner, it's ideal for novice users who want to simply overclock in one-click without a hassle to avoid potential artifacts, especially driver crash. For temperature-wise, I was getting about 50c-65c on average, depending on ambient room temperature. Speaking of aesthetics, I was very impressed that MSI listened to customer's feedback, in regards to red accent shroud which not everyone is a big fan of red color scheme. Since the MSI Gaming X Trio RTX 2080 Ti comes with Mystic Light RGB, then it makes sense to remove red accent shroud to compensate and balance the color tone of their rig, regardless number of peripherals that uses RGB such as Creative Sound BlasterX AE-5 PCIe Sound Card including LED Strip, G.Skill TridentZ RGB RAM, etc. For those customers who are concerned about price point, the RTX 2080 Ti is specifically designed for enthusiast gamers who wanted best of the best performance while still anticipated for upcoming games with RTX and DLSS Technology, especially with high refresh rate G-Sync Displays such as (4k) 3840 x 2160 144Hz IPS Panel, 2560 x 1440 165Hz TN/IPS Panel, and/or 1920 x 1080 240Hz TN Panel. DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is basically new Antialiasing technique that allows Turing Tensor Cores to train A.I. via neural network to not only deliver best image quality, but also boosts performance, regardless game title. In the past, gamers are left with several AA options such as MSAA, Temporal AA, FXAA, SMAA, SSAA, etc. From my experience, I normally use SMAA since it has less impact on performance while maintains image quality. Downside is that it doesn't fix all jagginess and shimmering artifacts, regardless resolution. RTX, on the other hand, impacts visual fidelity and greatly enhances in every part of the game such as Ray-Traced Reflections, Ray-Traced Diffuse Global Illumination, Ray-Traced Shadows, Ray-Traced Ambient Occlusion, Variable Rate Shading, etc. Thankfully, more major titles have been announced at Gamescom 2018 which supports RTX as well as DLSS such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Battlefield V, Metro Exodus, Final Fantasy XV, PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battleground), you name it. Note that some games may support RTX only while some games may support both DLSS and RTX like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, for instance. But all in all, it was absolutely worth it to upgrade from GTX 1080 to RTX 2080 Ti. Hopefully in the near future, I would like to see more RTX games announced in 2019 such as Resident Evil 2 (RE Engine), Gears 5 (Unreal Engine 4), Doom: Eternal (id Tech 7 Engine), etc. Not to mention, RTX is compatible with DirectX 12 (w/ DXR) API, Vulkan API (Ray Tracing Extensions), and OptiX API for CUDA. For those of you who have RTX 20 series graphics card, Microsoft released October Update including DXR API for Windows 10 which is mandatory to benefit RTX feature. With that being noted, I am extremely happy with the results, and I'm also extremely lucky that I pre-ordered MSI Gaming X Trio RTX 2080 Ti right before it ran out of stock. Now unfortunately, it is currently out of stock due to high demand, but hopefully there'll be more supplies in stock. For more information, you can also check out other journalists & article reviews which I highly encourage to check it out since they go in depth about test setup, power consumption, temperature, game performance, overclocking, packaging, and so on so forth such as Guru 3D, Techpowerup, Overclock 3D, Wccftech, Pcper.com, Hardware Unboxed, etc.

P.S. Yes, I have pre-ordered MSI Gaming X Trio RTX 2080 Ti on August 20th. Even though the original release date was September 20th, somehow it was delayed until September 26th, and then Newegg shipped the graphics card via Smartpost which took two days to ship by FedEx, and then on next day, it was finally delivered by USPS. As soon as I received the box, there was no damage, no bent, no scratch, and the package itself was safely intact. So in the meantime, I will be waiting for Intel Core 9th Generation Coffee Lake 8-Core CPU which I will definitely purchase Intel Core i9-9900k to replace Intel Core i7 8086k for better performance and better overclocking stability, thanks to its STIM (Soldered Thermal Interface Material).",Danny L.

$179.99,It is loud,rating rating-4,2020-05-09,5/9/2020 12:28:20 PM,"Pros: It's better than my R-290 but it's not great. The fans are loud. I'm not sure whether it's the chip or the fan control software. The chip doesn't get hot but the fans ramp up and sound like a 747. A distant 747 but they sound like a jet.Cons: It's loud and not very powerful. My old card scored almost as good. I have buyer's remorse about the whole build. My i7 3770k was almost as powerful as the Ryzen 7 3700x. I got a few thousand points benchmarking after this build. It wasn't worth it.Overall Review: If you are running an Ivy bridge and an R-290 or better, save your money.",Jonathan R.
$179.99,"5 eggs, so far",rating rating-5,2020-05-02,5/2/2020 7:32:47 AM,"Pros: -Works just fine
-No hassle with CrossfireX, just plug in and play.
-With settings, both cards take turns dropping in fps. So a 60fps setting in a game turns into 30fps for each card.
-Runs quiet, though I don't overclock.
-Manages to keep cool.
-2 cards fit just fine in the motherboard.Cons: -Never heard of Power Color.
-The Radeon Software is a nightmare. Most settings have to be found. Much rather prefer GeForce panel because, as I said, I don't overclock. I thought ATI would have kept it simple, but you actually have to google where to find some things. Obviously geared towards ""extreme"" gamers. Ridiculous.Overall Review: Perfect mid-range cards for the price from an unknown (to me) manufacturer.

$179.99,Great card for the money,rating rating-5,2019-05-30,5/30/2019 12:54:40 AM,"Pros: -Huge performance increase over my old R9 280
-Cooling works amazing, it's loud when you work it hard and the fans go to about 50%+, but on the bright side, I can't hear whatever my girlfriend is watching on the TV behind me
-The price, I COULD NOT for the life of me find an 8GB RX580 at this price anywhere(I bought it on sale, but I found even at regular price, this thing was a lot cheaper than the competition).Cons: -Not really something bothers me, but you should really know that these fans are very loud.Overall Review: Highly recommend this if you are on somewhat of a budget, and play games at 1080P
Note: If you had a card a few generations older and you were using an adapter to do DVI to VGA, you'll need to get a DVI-D cable to use this, or ANY card on the market today, DVI-I is no longer used.

EDIT May 30/19:
Owned this card for a little over 6 months now, and I push triple monitors with it, it's not the best performance in games, but I think I'm CPU limited(FX8350), I was incredibly skeptical about buying from PowerColor due to some of the other reviews here, but I am still pushing this thing everyday, with no issues.",Tyson D.

Not so bad on heat.Cons: Not really overclockable but can get a slight bump out of it though not enough to really matter imo.

The one ""free"" game I was able to get played well enough.Cons: Fans can get loud when under heavy load.
I was suppose to receive two games with the purchase price but due to amd rewards shoddy set up, I could only get one.
Frankly without the extra games there are better cards in this price range.
I for one will no longer trust amd rewards to make good on their offers so my money will go elsewhere.Overall Review: Based on the price without the offered games I do not recommend.",William H.
$179.99,Don't really understand the negative reviews are about.,rating rating-5,2019-03-07,3/7/2019 4:05:19 PM,"Pros: -Very very cheap! I brought mine for $170 and it came with two games.
-This card is NOT hot at all. Avg. 70'C under full load. In comparison, my EVGA 970 reached 79'C. (tested with same games same conditions)
-Fan is QUIET. Avg. 1700 rpm under full load (default profile). 0 rpm under 60'C. Even if you are not happy with default, you can simply tune the fan speed yourself.
-I did NOT experience any blackout or flicking issues.
-Freesync is amazing. It makes every game feel so smooth.Cons: Nothing. I got what I paid for.Overall Review: I didn't expected much since this card is dirt cheap when I buy it, and I saw quite a bit of negative reviews. Maybe they release a new version or something, I don't know and I highly doubt it. My card has none of the problems as mentioned in some reviews.
If you are using old gen card and looking for some cheap upgrade, don't worry to purchase this card IF YOU SEE THIS IS THE CHEAPEST ONE.

Would easily go over 3500 rpm, which is only fine if you are into airplane sims and want to get some jet engine noise for more immersion. Make sure you use MSI Afterburner or other similar software to control the fan speeds. Even after tinkering with a custom fan curve, it's still pretty loud compared to other 580 cards, but not unbearable.Overall Review: I bought this for $160 after $20 MIR in early December 2018, when it was the cheapest dual fan 8gb 580 by about $30.

Otherwise, it runs really nicely and I have had it for over a year and have had no complaints. At $250 during the mining boom it wasn't such a great deal, but at $189 or whatever RX580's are going for now, just pick up the cheapest 8GB card you can and call it a day.

-This card is dual BIOS : Left is max performance with 1350mhz OC and right is Silent mode in 1340mhz.
-Fan stop below 60 degreesCons: -Only have one 8 pins pci-express power connector. Only useful for some heavy overclock anyway.
-Sticker on fan are not center. People with OCD, be aware lol.Overall Review: -It's an inexpensive RX580 that deliver great performance with reasonable noise level.
-Come with aggresive fan curve and target 70 degrees, Make your own custom fan curve with a target of 80 degrees and it's very confortable to game next to it.",Mathieu C.

Runs what I play in ultra without issue, r6s mostly.Cons: Drivers are very finicky. Took some time to find ones that run my games stable. Though every now and then I get the green screen blink which just required me to reseat the HDMI cable. The DVI is best but sadly I use this on my TV so HDMI is my preferred method. and the issue could also be the result of running it all on a 65""Overall Review: Crypto currency really got us good. hopefully we can get back to the good old days where the value is better.",Jason M.

Really loud under load
hot hot hot.Overall Review: I don't know if the flicker is because of the drivers or the GPU. But it is quite annoying when in the desktop, browsing etc. Also, it took 6 days to get delivered from newegg.

AMD updates the software and drivers not PowerColor.Cons: I will not buy another product from this company PowerColor ever again. In less than 6 months the HDMI slot has gone bad. The DVI-D slot shockingly still works. After reading all the horror stories about the terrible customer service and taking forever to get the warranty work done or any response I'm afraid to send mine in. I can't wait for months to get it fixed or replaced. I use this for work, gaming and everyday life stuff. Also, why should I have to pay to ship a product to get warranty work done! It's not my fault that it broke. IT""S YOURS! 1/4 of the reviews on every site that sells this card are about a faulty card. To me it sounds like you guys make a lot of faulty cards. I should have read all the negative reviews first. I paid almost $400 for this card! I'm not paying to send it back to you. I'd rather pay to send you a box of poop because that's what you sold me.

$179.99,Fan problems,rating rating-3,2018-05-28,5/28/2018 10:24:27 PM,"Pros: Easy to install
Looks nice
Functions at factory specsCons: First card: Loud, high-pitched fan noise after a day of use. In the process of RMA because of it.
Second card: None so far other than value.Overall Review: UPDATE:
RMA'd through Newegg, only took about a week to get a replacement card. Had to pay $20 to ship it back to Newegg, which negated any ""deal"" I had previously gotten on this card. As for the performance: so far so good. The card is sturdy, doesn't run too loud or too hot under load, and does what it is advertised to do for all intents and purposes. However, given the current state of the GPU market, I regret taking the gamble with this card. Had I waited a bit longer I would have bought a better card from a more reliable brand, and likely have been more satisfied with my purchase. At the current pricetag, the card is not worth the risk. I'm bumping my rating up by one egg since the card at least functions, for now.

As a side note, if you're going to be playing Path of Exile, go with an NVIDIA card instead. PoE has historically had compatibility issues with AMD cards. Years ago I played the game on a 7770 HD and there were massive display issues. While the issues are far less understated today while using this card, there are still indeed noticeable display issues after upgrading from my GTX 760.",Patrick W.

Packaged well arrived quickly
Recommended to anyone looking for a cheaper RX580Cons: None really. Good for both mining and gaming. (I do both with the rig I bought this for to help offset the costs of the hardware)Overall Review: Not really a con more of a PSA (lol) but if you are buying this to install it as a second card in your Dell 5675 for crossfire you will need power cable extender as well. Not a big deal and they are pretty cheap but make sure your crossfire bridge is flexible and long and to pick up the power cable extender with it.",Grace S.
$179.99,Great card for the money,rating rating-5,2018-03-23,3/23/2018 4:42:11 AM,"Pros: As expected, this card plays everything smoothly at 1080p. It's quiet under normal use; it might be loud under load, but I have never noticed any noise or whine while gaming. I don't mine, so I can't comment about noise under heavy load in a quiet room.Cons: It still seems somewhat mysterious how to best use FreeSync in game, i.e., whether to frame cap, or use V-Sync, etc. The online advice seems ambiguous, but trial and error has worked ok so far.Overall Review: I purchased the card for $210 during the holiday sales; at that price it seems excellent.

Work well, After moving to Ethos I was able to get them all up to 28mh/s and should be able to do a bit more work to get them closer to 30MH/s. I still only get 22mh on windows 7Cons: EDIT: DIsregard Cons
I bought 6 of these. Stock Ethereum Hashrates are about 18 MH/s. Tested both on Windows and UbuntuOverall Review: Edit: I needed the latest drivers and a new version of linux or Windows 10 Pro. I was getting lots of OpenCL errors on Windows 10 home with blockchain drivers.
____________________________________________________
Do lots of research on these if you are going to be mining. I see lots on the forums saying they get 29 or 30mh but I'm seeing 18-22 and I'm seeing that on 6 different cards.Some are even saying overclocked they can't get them above 23.",Colin H.

$179.99,Randomly Goes to black screen durring gaming,rating rating-5,2017-12-23,12/23/2017 4:50:02 AM,"Pros: Powerful card, with 8 gigs of vram lets me play games on very high settings at very high fps. I mostly play overwatch and a few other competitive games and this allows me to run them at 1440p, over 100 (usually 120-130) fps with most settings maxed if I turn down a few things like light effects and such. With freesync, which is amazing, it feels like im mxing my 144hz monitor at all times. buttery smooth, no screen tearing, etc. This is my first experience with freesync and high rex and high fps gaming, and I am absolutely impressedCons: EDIT: I have amended my review, as it turns out that the black screen issue I was having was one with my monitor, not my GPU.

My only complaint is how loud this card gets under heavy load.

Oh, and do be warned that there are no drivers for Windows 8.1. I was not able to find any work around for this, and ultimately was forced to upgrade to windows 10 just to use this card.Overall Review: Overall, I love this card. I'd give it a 4.5 for the sound, but that rounds up.

In the end, if you're playing optimized ""e sports"" style games, this will push at or near 144hz even at 1440p with maxed settings. And it can easily get at least 60 fps on more ""AAA"" titles with the same max or near max settings at 1440p. Throw in freesync (which I'd assume would be why you'd buy this card over a 1060 6gb for a similar price) and its a wonderful gaming experience.",Justin W.

Terrible coil whine. Second card does not smell like its burning but WOW the coil whine is way worse than the first card
I've tested different motherboard and different psu with no success at getting it to go away
Power usage: the power usage on this card is about 15% higher than my RX 580 XFX XXX for no apparent reason under the same load and giving the same performanceOverall Review: I would recommend going with a different model, unless you can get a sceaming deal on this one.

$179.99,Overclocked like a boss and temps are great.,rating rating-5,2017-11-24,11/24/2017 12:38:48 PM,"Pros: I'm not quite sure what the other reviewers meant by this card running hot. I used MSI Afterburner to set a normal fan curve, and after 4 hours of playing PUBG the temperature capped at 67C with GPU usage at 100%, Core Voltage at +100mV, and Power Limit at 50%. This thing overclocks like a beast; it's 100% stable at 1500MHz Core Clock and 2250MHz Memory Clock. I can probably overclock it further, but I'm happy with a nice even 1500MHz Core Clock and 2250MHz Memory Clock overclock.Cons: It's definitely a little loud, but that's the cost of keeping the temps low at such a high voltage and power.Overall Review: I got this at around $300 CAD ($320 after taxes and shipping) and at this price point I think it's incredible.",Jake J.
$179.99,AMD fan let down,rating rating-2,2017-11-11,11/11/2017 10:49:40 PM,"Pros: Seems like a good upper mid tier GPU.
Physical build quality does seem solid despite the plastic fan shrouding.Cons: I might have recieved a defective card.
Still in debate if this card is a bit overkill for an AMD FX based system.Overall Review: I dont know if this is normal for these cards but under light load one of the fans likes to ramp up and down (not a lot) and i can hear some sort of electical noise every time it tries to change the fan speed. I dont think its just the fan noise i'm hearing. Would be less worried if the sound was a bit more consistant. While in more demanding games the noise is always there which does not bother me much. Maybe its a driver or PSU issue? Troubleshooting is needed before i try and send this thing back.

All i wanted was the max GPU that an AMD FX chip could handle.",ANDREW M.
$179.99,"Great video card, works as advertised",rating rating-5,2017-09-18,9/18/2017 6:40:36 AM,"Pros: Simple setup, easy to understand, no secondary setup for LEDs beyond drivers. The AMD driver suite has a 'clean install' option for previous AMD card owners. The temperature of the card depends on what kind of case configuration you have, for proper details to understand how to properly setup your case go to GamersNexus or Linus Tech Tips or Paul's Hardware for instructions.Cons: Miners are causing the prices to increase. Vega 20 will be out soon.Overall Review: I had to replace my card, I purchased an XFX HD 7850 for $140 after rebates four years ago. That card was in a similar 'class' as this card, but because of the mining that gained popularity just after I bought the card prices haven't come down since then. That card died beause I neglected to clean the dust from inside the heatsink on the card, so it was overheating and eventually the GPU assembly probably lost contact with the motherboard. Louis Rossman demonstrated that you cannot simply stick your card in an oven, you need expensive soldering equipment, so I ended up replacing that card, with something that was now over twice the price. I really hope that AMD will come out with mining only cards i.e. cards that do away with video outputs and produce them in significant quantities, so that regular graphics card users can purchase cards without having to fight with other parties for the same stock.",Melita K.

I find this practice to be wise in both brands of vid card...a few of my friends have a habit of buying the new technology the very day they are released. then I get to hear all the nightmares and swearing for a couple of months. then a few short months later the cards drop down like 30-40% in price with nearly perfect drivers and I dive in!.. sadly this lesson is still not learned, they still must get them the day they are released lol",Jay V.

-Looks Good in my case
-Radeon Software helps quite a bit... just know how to utilize itCons: - It Gets REALLY hot, so have good fans
- Get Bloops every now an then, most were my fault
- Bloops that weren't my fault (not often)Overall Review: Overall, this is a stunning graphics card. Dragon Center can be a a bit of a pain at times, but a good uninstall and reinstall does justice.

REMEMBER, uninstall ALL previous GC drivers before installing this one. There are two 5700 xt versions. I downloaded the regular drivers instead of the 50th anniversary one. So the well known screen flickering was present because of bad drivers. I uninstalled these drivers and installed the correct, 50th anniversary drivers, and I had no problem. When first playing a game be a bit patient. How I see it, it ""configures"" itself for a first time set up for the game. I can play Tomb Raider at 4k with about 45 fps everything maxed out. I can also play Hunt: Showdown at 4k with about 30-45 fps with everything maxed out. For hunt, I may need to do some optimization. To me, 4k doesn't matter to much because my monitor is meant for it. At regular 1080p, I usually get above 60 fps. There is also an overclocking method with the GC so play safely!

Also make sure you keep the drivers up to date or it wont work.

MSI's version of this card works because of good engineering. I would stick with MSI given the option for this GC. Happy gaming!",Alexander D.

I've been playing ""The Outer Worlds"" with this and a Ryzen 3600x on 16gb 3200 RAM on VERY HIGH settings 1440p and am averaging high 80's to low 90's FPS. Can get to above 100 if you set some of the more draining settings like Shadows down to ""High""Cons: There has been some issue with it locking into 100% mode while using AFTERBURNER but runs just fine without AFTERBURNER running
It also makes a noticeable wind and maybe a slight... scrape? noise at that level.
It's also a VERY heavy card. There is some slight sag which makes it slightly uneven and might also be part of the ""Scraping"" noise I hear at the high fan % levels. Currently looking into a way to add support without looking terrible.
I'm using a x470 Gaming Pro Carbon MB (So it has the reinforced steel slots and still sags)

My only other issue with this is I can't control the RGB
As I said before, I'm using a 470 board. The option to control the RGB ONLY COMES ON THE 570's
I did try to download the ""DRAGON CENTER"" which was their 570 board option for the ""Mystic light settings"" (RGB Control) but it auto detected my board and stuck me with the Mystic Light version that is for my 470 MB...
So as of right now I have an amazing Orange and Black rgb design with a bipolar 5700xt and honestly out of everything is what annoys me the most.Overall Review: It's a great item, but be aware that it still has some bugs. And if you have ANY plans for a specific RGB theme make sure to get the 570 MB. Otherwise you'll be in the same boat is me.",Chance H.

Aesthetics
Manual/Artwork (Probably actually the best thing about this card)Cons: Overheating
Drivers
Issues running 3x 1440 144hz displaysOverall Review: I liked the presentation, the aesthetics, and the included items... Especially the manual (Which was honestly probably my favorite thing. The artwork in the manual is top-notch and I loved the little dragon). It's a very nice looking, and beefy card. I like both of those things!

With that said, I had nothing but problems since the first day with this card (I did wind up returning it and just getting a 2080ti instead). I was unable to run 3 1400 144hz displays. I'm not sure if this was a problem with the card, or maybe just AMD drivers.

I couldn't play any games with this. Games would CONSTANTLY have issues. For instance, starting Dota 2. The game couldn't figure out what display to put the window on. I tried different settings. Forcing windowed, or full screen. Dota 2 would CONSTANTLY (I mean every second or two) minimize, full screen, minimize. The screen would go black. I'd see Dota 2 for a second. Then minimize, full screen, minimize etc. It was a constant loop that would go on for about a minute or two before the system/Dota gave up.

You get the picture. It was a nightmare. It wasn't just Dota 2. I had issues with tons of other games. Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, CoD WW2.

I don't play at 4k. I don't even play at 1440. I play at 1080, vsync off and generally try to just get the best performance possible. I generally don't care how a game looks. I'm a pretty competitive gamer (SMFC/GE in CS GO, Diamond+ in Overwatch and other games, I used to raid lead 2 heroic progression guilds and had world rankings back in the day - Heroic as in pre mop) and so I wasn't pushing the card that hard. I never even TRIED to play anything at 4k. Probably the hardest thing I did was leaving heaven running for a few hours to stress the gpu when I first got it. Maybe that killed the card?

The card kept overheating, like a lot. The system would constantly hard lock. Like if you did some massive overclock and the driver couldn't recover. I would have to power cycle the machine. This happened ALL the time. It got to the point where the machine couldn't even stay on for 10-15 minutes at a time even just watching youtube videos (Seriously). I literally wasn't able to browse the web for long enough when trying to look for other people having the same problem.

I didn't do any crazy overclocking. The only thing I did in Afterburner was crank the fan speeds to 100% (I don't care about noise) and I added about 100mhz core clock and memory. I didn't touch core voltage whatsoever.

Maybe it's just bad airflow? I thought about this. I have a Define R6, I pulled off the glass panel and stuck a giant fan right into the machine full blast. I still had the same issue eventually. Maybe there was an issue with a thermal pad in the card, maybe it was just flat out missing some, I don't know. I didn't take it apart. All I know is it just had constant problems.

I tried uninstalling the most recent driver, I installed older drivers. Same thing. I even did a clean install of windows (Ya, formatted it and everything!). I then tried playing games without any drivers installed (Big shock, didn't help). Then installing the newest (Recommended, not optional) I still had the same problems on a CLEAN INSTALL of windows 10 1903.

I then went down to 2 displays. Maybe 3 is just too much? But nope. Same problems.

I gave up dealing with AMDs drivers, and all the constant problems. I just had to return it after several days of frustration.

Also, it's worth noting that when I would remove the card and put in anything else, I had no issues whatsoever. So... It's possible I just had a bad card; it happens. But this kinda stuff makes me not want to get an AMD gpu. I like their cpu's but their gpu's have nothing but problems and maybe it's just me but... It's just not worth the frustration.

I just gave up, I didn't want to deal with AMD anymore and just wanted to go back to NVIDIA. Sorry. :(

I still like the dragon though.",Thomas C.

$429.99,"Premium product, with a couple minor flaws.",rating rating-4,2019-10-15,10/15/2019 1:32:50 PM,"Pros: - The card has a very premium look and feel to it, nice brushed aluminum backplate.
- Performs great, paired with my 3700x and 32gb @ 3000Mhz RAM I get around 70-75 FPS at 1440p on Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
- Audibly the card is very quiet under load.
- Its a big card, and I mean BIG. Which I like for some reason. Fills in my case better.Cons: - Single BIOS, kinda disappointing no dual BIOS feature.
- The MSI game center app which is needed to control the RGB function immediately caused issues. The screen flickered constantly and I had to DDU all drivers and reinstall the graphics driver. I have not attempted to reinstall the game center app.
- Immediately after unpacking the card there was a 1-2mm scratch to the aluminum backplate, not a big deal but rather disappointing.
- Not a big fan of the RGB panel, either give an adequate RGB display or keep it entirely off the card. That design feature seems to clash with the rest of the card.Overall Review: Overall I am pleased with my purchase. I made a lateral move from a EVGA GTX 1080Ti Black Edition, this card performs better in the titles that I play @ 1440p. Overall its within the top 3 within 5700XT family, perhaps a refresh down the line will address some of these things i touched up upon. If I had to do it all over again, I'd most likely buy the Gaming X card again, but I would give the Sapphire Pulse real consideration as well.",Benjamin R.

$429.99,A Beast of a Card with Driver Issues,rating rating-4,2019-10-14,10/14/2019 8:32:33 AM,"Pros: - Great performance
- Silent at idle and barely audible at load
- Very low tempsCons: - Driver issues are a real thingOverall Review: If AMD can get the driver issues squared away this is a definitely 5-star product from MSI. On initial setup I could not get screen flickering to subside at 144hz. I tried all available drivers from AMD, CRU (custom monitor software to override settings), and even swapped out multiple monitors and display port cords to be certain (to no avail). What finally did the trick was uninstalling Dragon Center (MSI's GPU utility application) and underclocking and undervolting the card slightly. The card is now stable and running like a champ but it was not a fun process to get here.

The card itself is nice and comparable to the Nitro + and Red Devil variants by other vendors. I ultimately went with this variant because of the lower temps and ambient noise as reported by Hardware Unboxed. Be aware that it is recommended you use a 750 watt PSU instead of a 650 watt like other variants of the card. I don't care for the RGB lighting but if that's your thing it's definitely an added bonus.

So far I've only tested Sekiro (FPS unlocked) and the new Assasin's Creed but both games run perfect at 2K with everything maxed out. Have not had any game or OS crashes. Will update the review in a couple months.",Russ B.

The cards stays cool and quiet while tearing through games at 1080p without a problem. Well over 60 FPS (closer to 90) in everything. All most perfect 1080p card with killer cooler, and a great brushed aluminum back plate.Cons: To control the RGB you have to use MSI Dragon Center, you can't use the stand alone Mystic Lights. No reason for that other then to get people to use Dragon Center which comes with software I don't want or need. Without Dragon Center the card simply stays in Rainbow mode. So I will be disconnection the RGB header in the card. Dragon Center maybe good for some people, but MSI should just have a simply stand alone program just for the RGB.Overall Review: Overall, the card is great.

$289.99,Do not buy until they release a stable updated vbios.,rating rating-1,2020-05-06,5/6/2020 1:17:12 PM,"Pros: Very powerful
AffordableCons: Both FA0 and FA2 Bios were not stable for me. I assumed it was a FA0 bios problem as it would run the card at a higher speed but even the ""stable"" FA2 gave me problems.

Got many Black, Blue, and even a couple Green screens. Lots of crashing, very unstable. Couldn't play a game more than 2 hours. Many benchmark programs even crashed.

The computer would sometimes crash and exit the game/program but more often than not the whole computer would need a full reboot (blue screen). On occasion the computer couldn't even respond and needed a force-shutdown.

I spent hours researching and troubleshooting only to find that many other people using this card have the same or similar issues. Very unfortunate as some other manufacturers of this same card have none of these issues. This is not a Gigabyte problem, but just a 5600xt (and 5700xt) problem from the research I did online.

It's too bad that this card had a lot of potential but I opted to return RMA and used that money toward an RTC 2060. At the time of this post many RTx 2060s are on sale right now so you could probably find one for not much more than this card. Paying a little extra from the start and saving all the time I spent troubleshooting would have been nice in the end.Overall Review: tl;dr do not buy this without doing some research on whether there has been an update to make the card more stable. It would be a great purchase at this price if the card could actually run without crashing. My recommendation: purchase a discounted RTX 2060 as there are quite a few clearance sales to make way for the next gen RTX 3000 series.

It renders Minecraft in an odd way, with lines around each individual block.Overall Review: If you're planning on playing Minecraft this is not the card for you.
It is a fast card, but just doesn't work the way I hoped it would. I'd say just go with the Nvidia option, it's much safer.",Kristal H.
$289.99,This card is a BEAST,rating rating-5,2020-03-24,3/24/2020 9:06:28 AM,"Pros: -This card runs every game at maxed settings 1080p with no problems, tho I havent tested it at 2k or 4k, I know it will do a nice job
-Easy to install, not a single driver issue, update the vbios to FA0 for even better peformance
-Excellent design, and the RGB logo is a nice plus I like

I think this card was initially competing against Gtx 1660ti, but after the vbios update it can compete with any rtx 2060 and surpass it in some scenariosCons: Nothing at all, but this card is heavy so make sure you have a gpu holderOverall Review: This card is a perfect choice for its price, it can compete with any 2060 or 1080",CRISTIAN M.

When I first got the card, brutal stuttering in almost every game I played.
Recently, it's stabilized however.Overall Review: Nice card, especially for the price, but I wouldn't take the risk at this moment. I would recommend waiting a month or two (as of March 2020) before making the jump, to make sure the drivers are indeed stablized.",Jonathan B.

- Updating the Vbios was super easy a literal click of the button after getting from Gigabyte's website.
- keeps temperatures down even while overclocked
- The actual card looks great and I like the RGB logo and backplate on the card.Cons: - a bit bigger than what I was expecting.Overall Review: - I would recommend this card who is trying to game on a budget, but make sure you install the new vbios it makes the card run a lot better.",Jared C.

Great performance for the price. Gaming on 1440p 60 fps easily with a few tweaked settings.
Gigabyte's support is awesome, updates are frequent and they are very aware and communiocative.Cons: Not much to say here and any comments are more towards AMD than Gigabyte or this model.
Radeon software and drivers need some fine tuning and some of the features can be improved. Most of them are quite gimmicky unless you're rocking a very powerful card and/or high refresh-rate monitor.Overall Review: Great value

- Backplate feels solid
- Easy to update to new BIOSCons: - None as of nowOverall Review: This is my first time buying a GIGABYTE card and so far so good. I'm impressed with the build quality. The card stays under 70C no matter what game I am playing on the new BIOS. It will boost in the high 1600's and low 1700's all day long. The only problem is how AMD decided to release a new BIOS last minute which didn't give vendors enough time to have all their cards on this new BIOS version. However it is very easy to update the bios on this card.",Brian D.

I not sure why everyone complains this runs hot. Running Maxed out on FFXIV or Doom eternal I am running about 147-150F at 75% fan. My GTX980 on my other system runs right around the same temp on the same games give or take a couple of degrees. And this is pushing a 55in Samsung Q80 with n o lag or tearing.",Mr. B.

Easy install, AMD drivers were a breeze to update
Not flashyCons: Does get a *little* loud under load
Not flashyOverall Review: Gaming rig: I would recommend this GPU if you are considering it for a first-time build (like myself), or a budget upgrade (previous CPU was an old i3 + Sapphire Radeon R9 280 3GB). The fans do kick in fairly quickly, but honestly the more air circulation the better - you should have multiple case fans at this point in time. Most temps are 60 to 70 based on what I'm doing. You won't hit super-ultra settings for a lot of AAA titles but everything should look and run very well.",Stephen K.

I replaced the thermal paste which lowered the temps 2-3 degrees but it is still remarkably hot.Overall Review: The rx 580 is a great card however this particular card is not a good option due to the temperature in game and loudness.,Tyler C.
$189.99,Would not recommend.,rating rating-2,2020-01-11,1/11/2020 10:40:17 AM,"Pros: The Card runs well, it can run games at low medium graphics.
good for non-gamers if you were to buy thisCons: Card overheats immediately when in a game. it practically sounds like a jet taking off in my computer and its ridiculous. it makes the entire computer hot and I had to put an extra fan in and set it so it was blowing directly on the card.Overall Review: Would not recommend it. This card for the quality is not worth the price. it says its meant for cooling but it does not cool at all. Do not buy this card especially because it doesn't have invidia and it overheats the card and your system.",Bryson H.

The casing was blocked by my NVME heat sink. Motherboard: AsRock 570Overall Review: I'll be happy when this trend of making your hardware look ""lit"" for the gamers passes because it's a headache fitting all this extra ""swag"" into a low profile machine.",David W.
$189.99,Good budget GPU for mid-range systems,rating rating-5,2019-12-31,12/31/2019 5:41:42 PM,"Pros: - Plays all games with good to great graphics settings.
- Reasonably quiet, what noise it does make is only during gaming, and is easily ignored.
- Stickers!!! Comes with a whole pad of stickers, the only part of my system that came with more than one sticker.
- Made by MSI.Cons: - Shroud is black and white. Would look better as black and red, like MSI usually is, but hey, function over form.
- The whole card sags a bit, though I remedied most of this problem by routing the power cable above the card and giving it a little tension.
- I'm not sure this has anything to do with the card itself, but I have been experiencing games occasionally crashing, or Windows BSOD, though less frequently. I still haven't gone through more than a few solutions as of right now.Overall Review: If you're not looking for top of the line graphics, or you don't want to spend many hundreds of dollars on a graphics card, then this card is perfect. It works quite well for its price, and in a personal system, is honestly the most you need for more casual gaming. As a future game dev, I know that I'll need to upgrade in the future, but this is more than adequate for the time being.

$189.99,great AMD GPU value,rating rating-4,2019-10-09,10/9/2019 1:38:36 PM,"Pros: 8 gigabytes of memory
runs my 31"" 2k monitor at 95-100 frames per second on PUBG
purchased for $200 USCons: RX GPUs tend to run hot and this one is no exception
When playing PUBG for the first time with normal fan curves, card hit 72 degrees Celsius.
GPU fans will cycle from 30% to 60% to 100% in less than 5 seconds when game comes on which is loud.
I opened my fan control panel and set all case and CPU fans to 100%, plus I took the dust filter off of the top of my case so the fans in top of the case can exhaust out without restriction.
Now I can play PUBG and the GPU sits at around 62 to 63 degrees Celsius with the added air flow
When playing the game, headphones block 98% of fan noise, so not really an issue for me.Overall Review: Without the heat issue and fan noise, this is easily a 5 egg rating for the price. It plays my games at a high frame rate without issue. It does very well when streaming video or searching the web. But if you want to get the max frame rate out of your games, be prepared to reengineer your system for maximum air flow.",DWAIN H.

$189.99,I am impressed with this card,rating rating-5,2019-07-09,7/9/2019 3:14:09 PM,"Pros: For a while I was running a mining machine with about 5 different cards to make a comparison.
This card was either in first of 2nd place. Maybe I just got a really good card. It seems like the memory on this card works really well. It did better than other cards that had more robust cooling and were more expensive. I would not hesitate to buy a bunch of these for a mining rig. Mine took months of mining and it performed really well.Cons: Maybe the cooling could be a bit better but it works great. Does not seem to detract from the performance.Overall Review: Its a great card and I don't think you could buy something more expensive that could perform better.
It was a surprisingly solid video card for me. Great value for the price.",Jason C.

Excellent price to value compared to the GTX 1050 2GB I bled for during the mining craze.Cons: Would make an excellent toaster, this thing runs pretty warm and the fans have to run with even the slightest load.Overall Review: At this price point I can't complain about the heat the RX580 delivers. I went with this MSI version instead of the Asus 3 fan because this one can be used with a legacy bios. If you have a UEFI bios then spend a couple more dollars for better cooling.",Stephen H.

- AMD Wattman causes crashes, best solution I found is stick to the MSI Afterburner for OC.

- other may be cheaper, but you get what you pay for, MSI service is excellent, forums filled with knowledgeable and friendly people willing to help. I can never say enough great things about MSI, without sounding like I am paid to endorse (I'm NOT, I just love the brand THAT much).",Philip N.

I use it for post processing large photographs with dual color calibrated matched monitors. It is easy to install and calibrate and shows a beautiful 1920X1200 image.Cons: The first card I received failed within 15-20 minutes, it was when booted up for the second time it failed to boot. I called Newegg and they immediately processed a Replacement RMA. It made me feel like I was MSI's Quality Control tech, and I am still worried about how long this unit will last. I will provide another update if this card does fail, I won't try for a 3rd time on any product.Overall Review: If you are a gamer you can find other cards that will be faster and better for the latest games, for more $$, but I do not do games. I do photography and shoot large RAW files. This card does handle what I throw at it with either dual Display or HDMI ports and/or a single DVI output.

It stays cool due to the help of its fans; it has the heatsink to keep it cool too. Great resolution and it is always ready to take on multiple tasks as well. I have two large screens and they function great.Cons: NoneOverall Review: recommend",Miguel m.
$189.99,Great Graphics card for the budget build.,rating rating-5,2019-04-23,4/23/2019 8:30:55 AM,"Pros: First I did not buy this from New Egg. I got it from that other online store that starts with an A. Feel guilty but rest of my PC build came from New Egg. As with most I got to the graphics card on my new PC build and was running low on funds so I grabbed this card. It runs everything I throw at it. Tom Clancy's Division 2 58 fps, Battlefield 5 52 fps, Farcry Primal 60 fps plus, WoW forget it not even working hard, and all my older games at Max settings.

I picked this card do to it being able to run everything that is out now and with it being able to run CrossFire with another one which I will get in the near future. $200.00 card can not go wrong.Cons: Non at all. Will run everything that is out today.Overall Review: Motherboard: X470 GAMING M7 AC

$189.99,"Works as intended, loud fans",rating rating-4,2019-04-23,4/23/2019 1:04:57 AM,"Pros: Runs well. I don’t play many games that require a lot to run but it worked really well for the games I played (Have only played Minecraft and Left 4 Dead so far).Cons: Really loud even on low fan speeds, this is a problem for anyone that wants to record. Fortunately I use a program with noise reduction so it’ll help but the fans are still loud...which can get annoying. Also can get kind of hot, using MSI Afterburner to cool it down but this also goes with my last con; it gets loud. If the loudness doesn’t matter to you, then you’re fineOverall Review: I think it’s good for the price and it also included free games with the purchase, so that also drew me towards buying it",K T.
$189.99,Product is good but,rating rating-4,2019-03-27,3/27/2019 11:21:33 AM,"Pros: Card works well for an older card.
Runs Division 2 at 60 fps. Still adjusting the settings in game to optimize.Cons: Card is flimsy. Heavy Heatsync/fan.
This card would benefit so much from a backpate.Overall Review: My experience so far with the card has been good. It was two other instances that soured my overall experience. These have nothing to do with the MSI Card and it's performance at all.

Firstly. When they say that you get the games for free as a gift, you have to know that you will still pay for the game. Your Card gets the 129$ discount to offset the Gift. I thought it was strange to do it this way and maybe they have to do it this way but it seemed a little underhanded that the site says you get a free gift and you end up “paying” for the games and get a heavily discounted video card.

Secondly. AMD Rewards dot com sucks. My first issue is that I bought the card and when it was shipped I received my “gift” voucher for the games. Fine. I got my voucher. I’ll go download the games and play them a bit while I am waiting for the video card to arrive. NOPE. You have to have the video game installed to Validate the game. They will not give you the game until there is a 570 or 580 video card in your computer. I found this frustrating because since I technically “Paid” for these games, I should have access to them immediately. I had to wait until I got the card before I could even register the games. Extremely offputting.

Thirdly. I created an account on AMD Rewards dot com and something strange happened. About 3 hours after I created the account my Ubisoft account started sending me messages saying here is your access code. I received 34 messages from Ubisoft to log in. I thought this had something to do with my new AMDREWARDS account so I logged into it and put in a ticket with the site. They said I had to wait 5-6 days for any help. I decided that I would have to disable the account. After disabling the account the messages didn’t stop. I went into my Uplay account and made some changes to my account. I then had about a day of silence. I thought it was over. I then started receiving the emails again. I received a lot of messages. I made some more security changes and I haven’t had any issues since. Needless to say this is the first time I have EVER had an issue with any kind of Software Distribution Software and the issue popped up right after I created an AMD Rewards account. I run virus/malware scans on my computer often and have never had an issue. I think this is too much of a coincidence to not mention it.",Steve M.
$189.99,Great for the price,rating rating-5,2019-03-01,3/1/2019 1:57:29 PM,"Pros: Looks cool
Performs well
Easy to set upCons: Kind of sags down in my motherboard, might be my problem.
Fans are a little loud, but I don't mind.Overall Review: If you are doing a mid/high end setup and want to save some bucks, get this card. It gives the 1060 a run for it's money.",Cole R.

-Drivers can be found on amd.com
-Runs most games 60 Fps (1050 resolution), (Assassins creed Odyssey is around 20-50 depending on location)Cons: -The drivers sometimes are finicky, and you have to do a clean install of the Graphics drivers in order to get the Radeon Control center to show up.Overall Review: I would recommend this to others looking for a mid range graphics card. Plus it comes with two games.",Steve P.
$189.99,"It's a nifty, good-looking card!",rating rating-5,2019-01-16,1/16/2019 11:27:39 PM,"Pros: - Looks great with black/white contrast builds
- The right card for 60FPS @ 1080p, of courseCons: For the card? NoneOverall Review: - The AMD software is okay, though it keeps wanting me to update to the ""latest"" software (it's in correlation to the Adrenalin control panel and not the GPU drivers themselves). The card itself will power the games with no problem and still would recommend it.
- The instruction manual included with the card suggested that I use...rubber gloves...to install the card. I used only an ESD wrist strap to install this card and other components in my new build.
- I've built this inside a Corsair Crystal 280X with 6 case fans running at 1000RPM (because anything higher than 1200RPM for the Corsair LL RGB series fans add a LOT of noise). If your card is hitting around 75C and higher, it needs cool air. If not more case fans, the right orientation should do it (pull fresh air up into the GPU in most PC cases).
- Using Overwatch, I've seen the GPU as cool as 35C when starting the game, GPU fans kick on around 54-55C, and hovers around 65-70C when in combat.",Dustin H.

-A bit better than rx480
-3 year warrantyCons: -Have not received AMD gift code after purchase, purchased 11/14/18Overall Review: Does AMD/Newegg (or whoever runs those gifts) not have there stuff together or am I intentionally being decieved out of the AMD gift code that is supposed to come with the purchase of this GPU?

Good priceCons: Card is paired with Ryzen 5 2600 in Phantek P350X chassis. Very similar to another build from last year were I used Phantek P400 with Ryzen 5 1600 and MSI RX580 Gaming X. what I have noticed is that this new build runs hotter than last year build and I do think it is because this Graphics Cards creates more heat than the Gaming X cardOverall Review: Absolutel for gaming build optimized for value",Helgi S.

$189.99,"Caused BSOD, Drivers crashed system",rating rating-1,2018-12-28,12/28/2018 8:32:30 AM,"Pros: When it worked, it had very nice graphics, but for me that was compared to a GTX 560ti.Cons: Started playing COD 4, game crashed back to windows. Thought it was a fluke so loaded the game again. Played one match then froze windows which required a hard restart. I thought it was maybe getting hot so I loaded up MSI afterburner. Temps were in the 60's. Thought perhaps I needed more updated drivers. Started driver install from MSI. Screens went black during driver install, and never came back on. Rebooted system and screens turned black after mobo posted.

I'm not sure if the issue was an actual hardware issue or a driver issue from AMD, but either way the product was unusable.Overall Review: I took a chance trying to do my part to minimize the monopoly that team green has, but unfortunately I am heading back. Also, will not purchase from MSI again, as the broken English on their website and software seemed quite unprofessional, and made navigation difficult.",Nicholas B.
$189.99,Highly recommend over the GTX 1060,rating rating-4,2018-12-10,12/10/2018 7:30:50 PM,"Pros: - Great performance in games
- Drivers have matured making performance significantly better in NVIDIA optimized games
- 8GB of VRAM makes it fantastic for future games
- Neutral color scheme
- Not as power hungry as other RX 580's
- Ultimate bang for your buckCons: - No backplate
- Fans are LOUDOverall Review: - I wish it had a backplate like its successor, the Armor Mk.2. However that card is not color neutral and so it did not fit into my build.
- Wish the fans were more quiet.
- FANTASTIC for the price if given the choice between this and a GTX 1060 6gb, I would always recommend this card, simply because it runs better in plenty of games.",Brad N.

Decent performanceCons: I paid 260$ during the mining craze.Overall Review: I mined on it nonstop in between gaming sessions without giving it time to cool off. The card has worked flawlessly and I never have a problem running games @ 1080p 60fps (which is what my cheap monitor can handle)",BRADFORD D.
$189.99,Great for 1080p gaming,rating rating-5,2018-11-18,11/18/2018 12:10:28 PM,"Pros: - Excellent performance for 1920 x 1080 gaming
- 8GB VRAM is already useful with some games
- Silent when not gaming
- Quiet while gaming with custom settings in the driverCons: - Fans can be noisy with default settingsOverall Review: This is really an excellent graphic card for gaming without compromise at 1920 x 1080. The card can be noisy under load with default settings. However, activating ""Radeon Chill"" and slightly undervolting the card in the driver will do wonder and bring the noise down to an unbothering level.",Carl S.

-decently powerful
-affordableCons: -Runs hot

$189.99,"First Review: Solid card, just minor issues here and there. - Second Review: AIO water cooling W/ Kraken G-12 GPU Bracket",rating rating-5,2018-10-30,10/30/2018 6:58:07 AM,"Pros: First Review with stock fans and heatsink
-Does exactly as advertised with the listed specs.
-Has ran for a year with no *severe* problems, an occasional crash in newer games if it got too hot, see cons for more.
-Easy to set up a fan profile on MSI afterburner that makes it near quiet at idle, but pick up accordingly at higher temps. I'd say this is a must because I honestly did not like their fan system, that turns off at low load or idle and picks up during gaming/high load activities.

Second Review as of water cooling with a Corsair H-75 AIO Liquid Cooler
-The Kraken G-12 GPU bracket works on this card with no modification to the card or bracket whatsoever, just removal of the heatsink and fans. Once I attached the liquid cooler, the temps went down from 78-82C to 58-62C, so if you wanted to cool this type of card like this, it's both possible and effective.Cons: First Review with stock fans and heatsink
-Like I mentioned above, it was getting ridiculously hot, on inspection I noticed something... pretty stupid. Whoever's job it is at MSI to screw the heatsinks down to these things isn't doing a good job, mine was barely seated to the processor and the thermal paste looked ehh to me, so I cleaned that off and put some spare MX-4 I had on and now it won't go above 75-76C in newer games when it would hit 80-83C before crashing some games.
- Addressed in the newer cards in this series, but the lack of a back plate makes this a saggy card.

Second Review as of water cooling with a Corsair H-75 AIO Liquid Cooler
-Still a saggy card, but it's alleviated by having my computer case on it's side rather than standing it upright, along with having the Corsair's tubing kind of prop it upright in it's PCI-E slot.Overall Review: First Review with stock fans and heatsink

I'd 100% recommend this card, just I'd also stress to give them a good once over inspection to make sure everything looks right, because that stupid heatsink issue could have fried my card, I was just knowledgeable to know what could be, and what was the issue.

$189.99,Purchased this rx 580 used from a friend,rating rating-4,2018-10-11,10/11/2018 1:47:36 PM,"Pros: -Perfect match for a gtx 1060 6gb model.
-I like the extra 2gb of vram
-Plays most games on max settings at 60 fps 1080p.
-Good connection options
-My friend sold it to me for $130 dollars....like I'm passing up that deal. #bought itCons: -I feel like this thing is part of the sun. It gets hot as Hades! Idles around 35-40c, but any form of gpu load will put this baby in the 85c to 92c bracket. If you buy this card. Make sure your case has good air flow. I would recommend at the very least buying a pci express exhaust fan that pulls air out of a case. That should drop the temps by a ton. The fans push the hot air towards the case door. If you have fans on your case door as an exhaust setup, then you probably won't even notice any form of heat. The fans will push the heat out of the case appropriately.

-changing the fan profile made no difference in temps for me at load either.Overall Review: Dear MSI, this thing runs too hot for my liking especially for a device running for a few years. The average user is not going to know anything about air flow in their cases. It might not hurt to put a warning in the box involving air flow concerns. I could totally see someone burning these cards up because they had no idea. Also, the gpu box came with this little comic book that shows you a simple way on installing your gpu and other components. That was adorable. Not sure if it was AMD or MSI that came up with it, but it was nice.",Shannon H.

Got the AMD $150 bundle with this at the time of purchase and couldn't be happier.Cons: NoneOverall Review: I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good graphics card for a cheaper price then NVIDIA.

-Good size, fits in a mid tower just fine.Cons: -Packaging was a bit flimsy.
-GPU runs really hot, not recommended for air cooled towers.Overall Review: If you're in the market for a good 8GB GPU, the 580 is a good product. If you're running liquid cooling for your CPU and GPU it would be stellar product, but due to its heat issue I can't recommend it for air cooled cases. I ran a single 580 and my case temp went from a 24-26 Celsius range, to a 29-31 Celsius range. I personally don't care for liquid cooling because there is too much that can go wrong. I run a stock 1060 in my tower (air cooled) and it suits my needs perfectly, but if you have a reliable liquid setup and are in the market for a mid-tier GPU I'd highly recommend it.",Brennan S.

Running everything I play without breaking a sweat. I didn't like the preset fan curve in MSI Afterburner for this card. For those that don't know or read the fans are essentially off sub 60C, which is fine for most, but I like my components to run as cool as I can get them. Adjusting the fan curve manually fixed the issue and it now runs at a cool 45C playing BFA @ ultra with no discernible framerate issues at all.",James M.

Came with the AMD Combat Crate. Good value!!!!Cons: HOT !!! 65c at idle 82c to 88c and loud as heck playing PUBG not OK for me. Called MSI the first guy I spoke with was cool and said that was too hot and that they would replace it. Said he needed to email a manager. A week went buy no email. Called and they said they did not have a replacement and suggested I go through the RMA process. I did, here's what happened next.... That agent said ""Dear Rodney that Is normal temp especially if under load. if you still wish to send it in for rma service use the link below"" HUH? You're kidding me? One guy says that's not normal and too hot, next guy said it's fine. Make up your mind MSI. I installed an after market air cooler from Arctic. WOW!!! What a difference. Idles under 40c and under load 72c and quiet as a mouse. So why cant MSI install a decent cooling solution for their card. I have lots of MSI cards none of them run that hot. All NVIDA cards by the way. So AMD cards run hot...They need better cooling I say. Not happy with MSI I had to potentially void my warranty to get a good working card.Overall Review: Will never buy bundled items here on new egg. NOT handled well if there is a need for a return.

"$1,499.99",Awesome Card,rating rating-5,2019-07-30,7/30/2019 4:50:01 PM,"Pros: -Fast as Hell.
-Got mine overclocked to 2070mhz.
-Doesn't go above 60 degrees.
-You can't go wrong with this GPU if you game at 4K.

"$1,499.99",Ultra 4K 60FPS+ Gaming at an extreme price point,rating rating-4,2019-07-25,7/25/2019 1:47:26 PM,"Pros: -Achieves 4K 60FPS+ Ultra Settings in most games
-Stays cool, ~70C playing COD Black Ops 4 @6K DSR Ultra settings
-Easily overclockable, with a Auto-OC Option included via software.
-Looks sleek, premium, and not blindingly flashy
-Nice metal backplateCons: -Extremely expensive, especially compared to the 1080TI's pricing. The ray-tracing features of this card are still restricted to a literal handful of games, and the FPS drops are quite high. The DLSS is not even close to the picture quality of regular 1440/4K.
-EVGA Precision X1 Software, which lets you control all 3 gpu fans along with OC'ing is very buggy. Fan profiles will reset randomly, along with the program not starting up on boot when checked off with the option.Overall Review: I can't really recommend this product unless you really want the very best 4K experience NOW.
The Ray-tracing and the DLSS features are still in their infancy, there are very few games that support these features at the moment and they are not well optimized.

The card itself costs around the same as a mid-range gaming PC, so just keep that in mind - This card is for early adopters really.",Meei L.

Most of the time the fans don't even run, during intense gaming they do but are not really audible over my other fans.Cons: There are only two real drawbacks I've noticed with this card.
#1 it is HEAVY! This card WILL sag if you do not take measures to prevent it.
#2 it is BIG, this card takes up quite a lot of space and the VGA power ports on the side make it a super tight fit on certain cases.Overall Review: If you have the money and want to upgrade, this is a great card with enormous overclocking capabilities.",Joshua P.
"$1,499.99",The Mt. Everest of Gaming Cards,rating rating-5,2019-03-06,3/6/2019 6:54:42 PM,"Pros: Runs cool and quiet, nice looking! Smashes through games, even at 4k! (which is why I bought it) 11 GB framebuffer will hopefully let me game at 8k, even if I have to buy a second card for NV link! (fingers crossed)Cons: A tad heavy! Make sure your screws are tight! Couldn't beat my two GTX 1070's in a few ""SYNTHETIC BENCHMARKS"" (whoopty-do) It is on the pricey side, but to me, it's worth it! The nearly 3 slots it takes up makes it difficult to do two of them in SLI/NV link.Overall Review: So, I recently upgraded my 1st gen Intel Core i7 980X to an i9-9900k, along with 32GB of DDR4-3200, a 1TB M.2, and an Asrock Tai Chi Ultimate Z390, and I kept my twin eVga FTW 1070's to see if they would shine a bit better with a super fast CPU. Well, they did, but I was fighting SLI scaling. The two 1070's put up big numbers running 3D Mark and such, but I couldn't even run the 1st Crysis game from 2007 at 60 fps at 4k with all sliders to the right! Not to mention, Ghost Recon Wildlands either. So, after doing some research, watching videos and reading reviews, I pulled the trigger. I did buy directly from the manufacturer, but I wish I got it from Newegg for the free games offer. I was very hesitant about buying one of these because all of the nightmare micron memory issues and RMAs, but I did anyway, in hopes that I would land a card with Samsung RAM. Thank goodness I did! Needless to say, what I learned, is that you're better off with a bulldozer than a pair of small bobcats! This single card obliterated a few of my 3D Mark records by a mile! Some other 3D Mark scores were just a TAD lower than my SLI'd GTX 1070's. All in all, I am crazy impressed by this card. I doubt that I will even OC it, because it already boosts itself to 2050 MHz! As far as temps go, it sits at around 32c idle and gaming is around 62c. The card went into my Cooler Master HAF 932 case effortlessly, but if nVidia makes these things much larger, it will be difficult to squeeze one into my case! Bottom line is: real world performance is what it's all about with a card like this. I could have probably gotten by with a ""standard"" 2080ti, but hey, why do that? I wanted the fastest GPU, paired with the fastest current CPU. Stability and speed is paramount for my build, and those come with a hefty price tag. At least I can finally say, ""been there, done that""!",Rodney P.
"$1,499.99","Could be good, TBD.",rating rating-3,2019-02-20,2/20/2019 10:14:22 AM,"Pros: -Just made a new system build including this card and ran into problems right away, not to say it's the card immediately.
-Seems to run all my games 4k ultra 60fps just fine.
-Nice and quiet, perhaps the most quiet card I have ever owned.
-Heat is manageable.Cons: -Hoping it's not the card but I have been having serious stuttering issues intermittently until I rolled back Nvidia's drivers to an older version as the latest would give long lock ups in the desktop, as well as GeForce experience refusing to start or crashing entirely.
-Rolling back drivers seems to have helped with most of the problems but still getting long booting time after the fact and applications tend to stutter right after a boot (This happened after rolling to a slightly newer set of Nvidia's drivers) as I'm bargaining on the next iteration of drivers to actually be good if this is the case.Overall Review: Overall, when it works this card is fantastic, somewhat pricey but that a given, and hopefully I have no more issues than what is perceived as driver hiccups.",Brynn R.

-Quiet outside of the occasional coil whine. If you restart the computer, it goes away.
-Had a RTX Titan/Strix 2080 TI and both artifacted, this one seems good so far.
-First GPU I have used that has supported my Acer X27 in the sense it provides high FPS 4k gaming.Cons: -No GPU support bracket makes me worry about longevity/GPU sag
-Clearance with motherboard is extremely smallOverall Review: I would recommend this 2080 TI as I believe it is the best one on the market. I have yet to see over 75C even with hours of load. I used Battlefield V as a source for ray tracing and with highest settings/ray tracing/4k, FPS was reduced to around 35-40 whereas without it was over 70-80. Ray tracing seems to be more of a gimmick than application at this point, but the card itself is a beast. It runs almost identical to my SLI 1080 TI setup. I've found only one game (BFV, actually), where the SLI 1080 TI's win out. As most non-AAA games do not support SLI, I would highly recommend this card.",Logan S.

- very quiet, I don't hear the fans over my silent wings 3 fans
- has RGB and supplementary PWM fan connectorCons: - heavy, already seeing some GPU sag, I have ordered a separate support bracket
- the PCB and cooler came out of the box slightly warped, which initially worried me, but after some researching, this apparently can be part of the manufacturing process because of the huge heat sink. This should not, and in my case, does not affect performanceOverall Review: - I game at 4K on very high settings, and the GPU does go up to around 82C. On AC Odyssey, I get avage fps in the 80s, with highs in the low hundreds and rare lows in the 30s on the benchmark. While actually playing, I have not noticed lag or tearing, though I am also playing on a G-sync monitor.

After playing with the settings in my software and reaching a desirable overclock, I don't think I'll go back. This card performs so well under load that it's almost unbelievable. I upgraded from an AMD Radeon rx 380 which was also a mid tier card when I got it, but for the price(which is identical to when I got my previous card) this card performs SO much better.

Old machine would take anywhere from 30 to 45 mins to compile a 7-8 min video. Just compiled a 20min video on this new machine yesterday in half the time it would take to compile a video half the size before. It is not the top of line crazy speed, but a massive improvement and if needed you can oc this card as well.

$389.99,Very nice GPU,rating rating-5,2019-08-02,8/2/2019 2:33:30 PM,"Pros: QUIET!! Even when set to performance mode the fans hardly spin and when they do i cant hear it. RGB graphics nice. Fan Headers for front case fans a nice touch. Got this card on sale 10% off plus 20 rebate made it 357 total. Bought it down to the normal price i think it should be for a 2060 card. YES there are EVGA cards out there you can get for around 300 single fan 3 slot cards and almost got that one but when this one went on sale wasn't going to pass it up. If u want the best 2060 card out there this is the one to get. Was going for the Gigabyte Pro OC6G 3 fan model but after this sale the gigabyte was the same price so no contest at that point. Rog Strix wins and it is a little better built card.Cons: PRICE. Yes, if this card is not on sale i wouldnt not buy it. If u have room for a 3 fan card and want a QUIET model, the gigabyte Pro OC 6G card would be the one to get instead of this one. Rog Strix is just too expensive to recommend at the current prices these other vendors are going for. Software seems to be a bit buggy as i installed the asus lighting software and gpu tweak and then removed it as the tweak when my computer would go to sleep it needs a reboot to wake up the monitor again. Have read issues with their software.Overall Review: Still it is the top of the line 2060 card and it shows. Back-plate and the card is Heavy compared to the gigabyte. The heat-sink is bigger and wider so i dont think the fans have to work as hard. Though Gigabyte has its unique middle fan spinning the opposite direction to they say 'combat turbulence'. Not sure how much of a diff that actually makes. Any 2060 will clock about the same and performance wise speeds are all about even on any 2060 u get.",Marc S.

Does 1080p gaming at ultra settings at 59fps. Managed maximum settings on Skyrim special edition at 1080p at 59-60fps. That's my benchmark.

Does about 200-500fps in cs:go

100fps in Elder scrolls online

100+fps in PUBGCons: Don't ever touch the fans when they're spinning because they will break instantly into a zillion pieces probably right after the 30-day return policy runs outOverall Review: Wish I could return this and get a replacement, now I have to find some type of fan I can mount on this.

honestly just don't buy this, it's not worth it. Maybe if the fans were sturdier than a fortune cookie, then yeah. Three fans is great when all three aren't broken....when two fans are going at 90 my temps now go up by 15C more than before. Unacceptable",Brian C.

-My temps are incredible 30 at idle, in stress tess/benchmarks/intense gaming I never went higher than 58 degrees. Since my fans only start at 60, thats quite impressive especially overclocked, if the 3 fans ever kick in temps prolly will never reach anything above 60. Ill set profile to start at 55 degrees probably.
-I got to 2020 mhz overclock stable, got a good boost at memory too. Even people who got less had a nice boost too.
-DLSS will give nice fps gains if we ever get more games that supports it.
-Had absolutly no problems, no crashes, artefacts, be sure to DDU if you upgrade from a GTX nonetheless.Cons: -Will probably be a bit weak for raytracing, hard to say though, its new and probably badly optimized at the moment, and will probably depends on how developpers implements it.
-Really big, many ATX boxes will have problems fitting it in. I had to pry some metal ;)
-Quite heavy tooOverall Review: I really suggest you get this ROG STRIX over any other RTX 2060 models, the difference in temperatures and the well designed plate will definitly helps the card's lifespan, and the overclocks I got are quite awesome. Worth the few more bucks definitly. Well done !
If you know nothing about overclocking, OC scanner included in GPU Tweak II , or OC scanner in that other particular software(dont know if im allowed to suggest a software since its not included) will give you the boost you need , got up to 1975mhz.
Perfect for 1080p. On a sidenote, it overkills Resident Evil 2 Remaster at 4kmax , gpu almost stays idle got temps around 35-40 no bottlenecks on whole system. On a Ryzen 5 2600 oc to 4.1 . Thats some incredible game optimisation. Have fun!",Jean-Pierre R.

With it’s extra thick heat sink it runs very cool. I can run games all with the ultra settings and it won’t go past 55 degrees
Celsius.I'm not overclocking it cause you don’t need to. No fan noise at all. I do have a very good 1000 watt power supply, that might help with the fan noise that others have complained about, less voltage ripple. This is a great video card.

-Beefy cooler on XC Ultra, but put on water, so it was not really used.Cons: -Sli doesn't seem to work as well as it did with 1080ti cards.
-Price still high. Card is more than some people's systems.Overall Review: This is my second 2080ti, and this is a crazy good Black Friday price. The card works great, unlike my first card, right out of the box. No crashes or artifacts. This is the first card I have ever purchased with Samsung memory on board. I wish I could say that makes it better, but the Micron memory actually overclocks better on my other 2080ti. SLI doesn't work very well these days.

"$1,249.99",Had this since Launch. No issues,rating rating-5,2019-08-29,8/29/2019 5:57:00 PM,"Pros: -Giant heatsink/fans. Never goes over 70C
-Destroys every game at 1440p ultra with a 144 Hz monitor
-Ray tracing and DLSS supported games are finally starting to come out in big numbers (new COD, control, Cyberpunk 2077 and others will have support).
-Personally have had zero issues with the card after 11 months of useCons: -Ray tracing and DLSS support in games have been a joke until recently. I only enjoyed ray tracing in Metro Exodus and DLSS in that game caused weird artifacts. Now there are finally new AAA titles coming out that support RT and DLSS but it took forever.
-Card is massive, so definitely look at the measurements and you will have to buy a water block if you want to run SLI
-Price/Performance is not looking great these days, but it's still the best card on the market other than a Titan.
-Power consumption/Heat generation is very highOverall Review: I received this card like the day after it came out. I got really lucky with my order since tons of people waited one to two months.

This card never gets hot (always below about 70C). Even though it's massive I have not noticed any sag. I have had zero issues with the card so far and almost a year on it's running perfectly.

Is this card worth the price? Eh, debatable. It should be cheaper and if you're looking at a 2080 Ti past June of 2019 you might just want to wait a year and get whatever NVidia puts out next.

The ray tracing is functional and actually does look good in a lot of games. There are many more games coming out with Ray tracing and DLSS over the next 6 months so these features will actually start adding value to the card. DLSS was a shitshow but now it's working incredibly well in a few games and can double performance without any noticeable drop in video quality.",gregory s.
"$1,249.99",Exceeded Expectations,rating rating-5,2019-08-22,8/22/2019 9:25:45 AM,"Pros: Great thermals
Little to no GPU sag
Thick heatsink
Subtle RGB
Decent overclock headroom
Unique design
Can run Shadow of The Tom-b Raider on 4k with RTX on ultraCons: Fans are a bit loud and made a clicking noise when I first used it, but theres no longer any clicking noiseOverall Review: People tend to bash the 2080TI and basically all of the RTX cards by saying the price doesn't justify the performance. However, I disagree with that when it comes to the RTX 2080TI XC Ultra because it's fairly priced, cools really well, and it's a beast. I don't see myself having to upgrade my gpu for many years now because this thing is a beast. I was able to overclock it to 2130mhz and not for once experience any thermal throttling in 3Dmark or Heaven.

"$1,249.99","Great card on air, godly on water.",rating rating-5,2019-03-22,3/22/2019 2:54:47 AM,"Pros: Obviously it's a 2080ti, it'll blow your socks off. I ran a 34"" ultrawide @100fps. It'll hit this on ultra no problem, every single game. I play a mix of indie and AAA games. I did buy the evga aio cooler for this card. On air it runs hot at 83c underload and 52c idle. On water it's a cool 24c idle and 48c underload. If you can afford the coin for this card, you can afford 150€ more for a seriously good cooler to go along with your seriously good card. As it is default out of the box it's great.Cons: Runs stupid hot, imo the evga hybrid cooler is a must if you play on playing games at Max all the time because of the heat output. The price is another thing but that's subjective to how much income you can put into your hobbies. I don't see needing an upgrade for at least two or three years now so it's worth the money to me.Overall Review: Like I said, hybrid cooler turns this card from great to godlike. Don't get the more experience cards, get this one and add a great cooler and you've got a card that will outrun any other 2080ti.",alex r.

If you want RTX wait for the next iteration.Overall Review: I only picked this card up because I was waiting for the 20 series to upgrade my 980ti. With or without RTX I'm very satisfied with the performance and can run any game maxed. With the recent updates for RTX single player games with RTX BF5 are breath taking and get well over 60fps at 2560X1440.

"$1,249.99",Fastest consumer card just probably isn't worth it for most people,rating rating-4,2019-02-07,2/7/2019 12:34:08 PM,"Pros: - Fastest consumer graphics card unless you count a Titan RTX
- Massive beefy cooler that keeps gaming temps for me under 70 degrees
- 3 slot design but 2.75 size
- 10.6' length can fit into most cases
- RTX
- Very quiet
- Nice premium metal back plate
- EVGA customer service
- Best 4K gaming cardCons: - Simpy too expensive
- Some RTX cards are defective or become defective shortly after use
- No ray tracing or DLSS content
- Cheap plastic shroud
- 3 slot plus thick cooler means it will not fit into a lot of SFF builds
- Clicking grinding noise on fans during startupOverall Review: I personally only buy EVGA cards due to their high level of customer service. I previously had the XC version and when the fans started up or would ramp down they made a clicking grinding noise briefly, so I called EVGA and they cross shipped me a card and low and behold the replacement card still had that same issue and the card also didn't overclock as well as the original card and ran 5 degrees hotter. I actually kept the original card and decided to live with the clicking. Point being I upgraded to the XC Ultra and the same clicking noise is present. Not the end of the world just annoying for a $1250 card to experience this and really all of our expectations at this price point is what defines the RTX lineup. For $1250 people not only expect perfection but also a card that murders the previous gen GTX 1080 Ti and while the RTX 2080 Ti is the fastest consumer gaming graphics card, it's only about 20% faster on average compared to a GTX 1080 Ti unless you do 4K gaming and then the RTX 2080 Ti really shines since it is the only card that can do 4K gaming at at least 60 FPS or greater on ultra settings. DLSS and ray tracing are basically useless at this point even on a 2080 Ti since there is literally 2 games that use the tech and some would argue doing so not properly. However if a $1250 MSRP does not scare you off and you want the best of the best than yeah the XC Ultra is a great card since it's a three slot card but has the size of a 2.75 card yet has a massive cooler that in my experience keeps gaming under 70 degrees (I have been averaging 67-68), and at 10.6"" in length the card at least length wise can fit into many cases.",Joseph R.

Powerful card that can do more than just keep up with any game I've seen. Easy installation. Stays cool in big case with lots of fans.Cons: A lot of software issues, mainly DirectX. Lots of defective units going around and EVGA will make you pay to ship them back and get a refurbished unit in return even under warranty and could take up to 6 weeks unless you pay extra on top of the already high price. Lots of blue screening but seems to be getting better as the software updates.Overall Review: Would buy again if I was positive the DDR5 issues were resolved.

- With the default TDP (260W), it is able to maintain a temperature of 68-69C (room temp is 25C) in games and stress test, with a fan speed of 55%.
- Raised the power limit to 300W, in games the temperature can be kept at 74-75C, with fan speed less than 70% and still relatively quite, good enough for a 2080 ti with two fans.Cons: - The Precision X1 software that is designed for RTX series is still in beta.
- May not be able to fill into some small cases since it is 2.75-slots wide.Overall Review: - During idle, the fan will cycle on & off and make annoying click sounds. I searched this issue and it seems it is not because my card is defective. Thus, I just set a customized fan curve and keep the fan spinning with a low speed when idling, then the sound disappears. Not a deal breaker but it should be fixed in the future.",Yijun F.

- Runs relatively cool despite that.
- EVGA customer support is greatCons: First one started artifacting and freezing up my computer after a week or so of flawless usage. Had to RMA with EVGA. The replacement started artifacting and crashing my computer in just a few days (*while* the first card was en route back to EVGA). There's lots of reporting on the internet of 2080 Ti failures, and I don't believe for one second the official word that RMA rates aren't higher than past generations. Even if that were true, I just want to be one of those 99% that have reliable 2080 Tis.Overall Review: Nvidia basically has a lock on the high end market, so I wish there was competition here. But for throwing something at any 4k@60fps challenge, it's hard to beat this card. But this is a huge opening for AMD to produce something that with better production quality.

Visual representations on game that are GPU heavy are astounding, the performance over my EVGA GeForce GTX 1080TI SC2 Gaming is noticeable, no more artifacts or screen tears in ""big events"" while gaming (such as explosions or rapid shift in FPS)

The X1 software is still in beta and it shows.

$789.99,EVGA FTWWWWW,rating rating-5,2020-04-27,4/27/2020 9:46:31 AM,"Pros: Exceptional build quality. You may hold this item in your hands and feel how solid it is built. Backplate gives the confidence of handling it while keeping finger grease off the PCB.
EVGA customer service. I've never had to use it yet and this is my second identical card as I'm going for dual card built. I've heard good things about them.Cons: The pump. See below if you want to read a story.Overall Review: This is my second card of the same make and model. The first card is happily in a custom loop now, and I have an unused ""hybrid cooler"" in my drawer that I cannot flip online because of the great 3-year warranty (return card the way you bought it).

My first card had a really loud whining sound from the AIO pump and it is a known issue among EVGA forumers. My first rig didn't have the headers to split out the PWM control of the AIO fan and the VRM fan so I stuck a magnet under the pump to align the impeller to make the sound go away.

This second card is very quiet compared to the first card. The pump is still audible but it's at the level of those other AIOs using Asetek's pump like the H55. I don't use the supplied fan because my case needs the slim 15mm fan so I use a Noctua.

Performance - The card at stock hits 52C open-case running at 100% utilization. I'm able to overclock it to 2080MHz, maxing out the 17% XC VBIOS power headroom, doing 65C in the case. Once under my custom loop, I got to 2100MHz easily at 50C. This card is no FTW3 but for a reference PCB, you get a lot of PCB+VRM+chip. Couple the AIO cooling with Boost 4.0 and you have a winner here. If you get one with a silent pump. :)

During the removal of the shroud from the first card, I noticed that the pump bracket is very similar to that of a NZXT Kraken G12 and the pump is no different from other Asetek generics. I may one day try to see if I can swap out the pump with a H55 or even better, a compatible pump with 240mm radiator.

Installation - Just a short note about the radiator. If you're not familiar with radiators, the fins do move/ bend if you push on them. There is no real damage done but if you're concerned with resale value, may want to deploy the ""protection cardboard"" method while installing.",Teng G.

"$1,654.00",Used for Animation Rendering - Powerful and Power Hungry,rating rating-5,2020-04-14,4/14/2020 10:58:38 AM,"Pros: Very powerful
Able to overclock w EVGA software (X1 Precision)
Hybrid cooling allows for much lower temps than air cooledCons: Very power hungry
X1 software is not completely intuitive for noobs
AIO hoses may limit case fan use and require careful route planningOverall Review: I'm using 2 of these cards for animation rendering, so my use will be different than most users. I put these into a system that I built 5 years ago. Initially, I put in dual 2070 supers. They worked fine, but I needed faster render times, so I upgraded to these. I did my research, and my 860 watt PSU should have offered enough power. However, most PSU calculators ask for the GPU architecture, and not the specific model. This particular model draws up to 350 watts of power per card. Long story short, I was overdrawing my 860 watt PSU and causing hard crashes. I installed a 1200 watt PSU, and now things appear to be humming along nicely.

WIW, a single frame rendered (in Redshift out of Cinema 4d) with dual 2070 supers took 5.5 min. that same frame w 2 of these cards took 3.25 min. When rendering 1500 frames, that is a substantial time savings!",Eric S.
"$1,654.00",Smashes every game in 4K,rating rating-5,2020-04-12,4/12/2020 8:39:10 AM,"Pros: Fastest card on the market. At full load while overclocked this card stays under 65c.
Plenty of overclocking headroom.
Easy to overclock.
Beautiful shroud cover.
This card can run games in TRUE 4K.
Easy install.Cons: Power draw is massive at 379w.Overall Review: If you want Power and Cooling and overclocking all in the same package, this is your card. If you intend to overclock and you don't have a sufficient power supply I would suggest upgrading. Make sure your power supply is of the highest standards. This is not a graphics card to own if you want to skip on the other components. To get the max benefit from this graphics card you need top of the line or else you might as well just purchase any other 2080ti on the market. Well soon add this card into my water loop but for now it calls itself very efficiently. Playing in true 4K, I'm not talking about 3840x2160, I'm talking about 4096x2160, is a step above the rest.

"$1,654.00",So far so good,rating rating-5,2019-10-12,10/12/2019 11:19:17 AM,"Pros: After doing VR for two years with my 3770K and 1070 Ti FTW2, my recent upgrade to the 9900K and this video card are pretty amazing. I went with the hybrid mainly because the regular version was out of stock and there were some good rebates on it. Performance in VR and the RTX demos I've seen so far put this machine in a brand new class. Looks like I should be able to finally use flight sims at practical frame rates! Running on a Gigabyte Designare Z390. Very happy.Cons: You do need to know going in (and I did) that the pump does make a constant background noise. Mine is the normal noise (not the more problematic air bubble noise)--quieter than the fans when gaming, but louder than a premium fan system at idle. I'm not taking any points off for the noise since I knew about it ahead of time and it's actually less intrusive than I was expecting. I do have to say though that it seems to be capable of pumping out a lot of heat, which, of course, is the point.Overall Review: I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants top performance. I almost took a point off for price, but didn't since there are versions of this card quite a bit less expensive that I could have chosen, but it was my choice to go for the bit of extra performance over value.",David D.
"$1,654.00",Great card!,rating rating-4,2019-09-26,9/26/2019 3:09:24 PM,"Pros: This card is awesome, I OC my card and it never reaches above 58C on 4K resolution. It also comes out of the box with a decent auto OC, but chances are you are most likely getting this card to OC yourself. In previous reviews people complained about pump noise, but I’ve experienced no such thing, this card is super quiet. Also EVGA customer service is unrivaled so if you have any issues they do the best they can to take care of you.Cons: Only two cons I can think of and that’s the way it looks and price. I feel like for the price of the card it should look a little better then it does, it doesn’t look bad just the fan it comes with doesn’t have any rgb and the rgb the card has looks very generic. if looks really are important to you I would probably recommend the KINGPIN version. Also, the price. This card is awesome but if you’re not OC Or playing at 4K with 60+ refresh rate, or putting your gpu under an enormous load, I would recommend a cheaper rtx 2080 ti as this card will most likely be overkillOverall Review: I bought this card personally because I OC my components and liquid cooling is the best way to get enough headroom to get the best possible OC. From most people who have this card, you should expect to get temps from around 55C-60C .I’ve had this card for about a month and it’s been awesome. The only thing is if you buy this card, make sure to follow the instructions it comes with on where to place the radiator to get the best possible performance. Overall, only reason I’m giving this card 4/5 is for the price it should look a little bit better. I would recommend getting this card, but try getting it when it’s on sale!",Kevin L.
"$1,654.00",Fantastic GPU For 4K Gaming,rating rating-5,2019-08-08,8/8/2019 9:35:08 PM,"Pros: Significant upgrade in minimum frame rate in games coming from a 1080 Ti Hybrid. I use a 4K 144Hz refresh rate monitor which this card is best suited for, in my opinion. My current game of choice is F1 2019 where I see a 30 fps increase in minimum fps at times. Not to mention all of the graphical upgrades related to AA with this card in some games, it's a joy to use. The card runs very quiet even under heavy load and I don't see major core clock downclocking when temps rise, which is nice.Cons: I would like to have seen a larger 240mm radiator with this card. I understand that this could cannibalize sales of the Kingpin Edition card, though. I don't think a 120mm radiator is enough to cool this card if you game at 4K @ 144Hz.

EVGA Precision X1 did not work well for me. Caused crashing in benchmarking software before it even fully started up, at complete stock settings. Core and memory temperature are also higher for me under load compared to when I use another major brand's utility. For some reason X1 causes a higher load on the GPU compared to the other brand's utility, and I also scored higher in benchmarks without Precision. Usually I'm a big fan of Precision software, hopefully updates will resolve whatever was going on with my system and I'll re-install. Strange.Overall Review: Overall I am very happy with this card. Running the card with an i9 9900K and 4K 144Hz G-sync monitor, this combo is gaming bliss. Hybrid cooler is very much worth it. I didn't go into it expecting a miracle over air cooling. Just wanted a bit quieter of an experience with less down clocking under gaming load. And the card delivers. I've settled on a modest core offset of +125 for gaming, which gives me a core clock range of 2040mhz - 2100mhz, depending on temperature and power. It never goes below 2000mhz.

The voltage slider does nothing for me; I can still hit the same speed with the same core offset, just at slightly cooler temps by leaving it alone, which is great. My case is small, a Corsair 400c, so maybe I could squeeze more out of this card with some more air flow.

Buyers should be aware, this card runs HOT if you game at 4K @ 144Hz. My settings above after 3 hours of F1 2019 at ultra and highest AA (this card takes things beyond TAA in this game, it is truly stunning) resulted in a max core temp of 74C, which is still under the 88C threshold. For comparison, when I tried the game at 4K @ 60Hz my max core temp was only 55C. So if you game at 60Hz heat should be much less of an issue.",Jonathan P.

I've seen reviews of people complaining about radiator or fan noise. I've never experienced such nor any coil whines.Cons: Card is quite bulky. Radiator hoses could have been a bit more flexible and longer. Could have used more RGB on the card plate for vertical card mounting.
Card used to reach around the mid 70's celcius on full load until I've remounted the radiator as shown on the package installation instruction(quite tricky). I also added an extra fan for a push pull configuration. This however comes with a compromise to overall case aesthetics if you're looking for a clean looking setup. I also did not receive any posters or bonus games for paying such a premium. nonetheless, I'm happy with the product.Overall Review: It would have been more helpful if card installation instruction were more highly stressed. I've had to experiment with quite many radiator positions in order to optimize cooling efficiency. It would also be great if the hybrid kit including the fan and radiator were more aesthetically appealing. Radiator hoses are pretty stubborn to be moved around. EVGA should really introduce options to mount the radiator much flexibly . They should also provide instructions about overclocking to safe numbers that would not hurt the card.",Roger P.

-DLSS
-Only a two slot
-4352 CUDA Cores
-Very fast memory
-Runs cool at 72-74 degrees gaming
-Kills it at 1440P and really only true 4K 60+ FPS cardCons: -Styling with the clear plastic
-Runs a bit loud and fan on stock settings consonantly ramps up and down
-Price
-RTX features at this point aren't being utilized
-Not the best overclockerOverall Review: The RTX 2080 Ti cards are the fastest gaming cards money can buy and boy do you need a lot of money. The card offers real time ray tracing and features like DLSS but those features aren't being utilized at the moment since there are zero games at launch that support these features. While I applaud EVGA for making a 2 slot GPU when most companies are doing 2.5-3 slot GPUs the clear plastic shroud looks worse in person compared to pictures. Simply it just comes off as cheap. Since this is only a two slot card this easily fits in my SFF NCase M1 and works with my SF600 PSU. Temps IMO are very good at a stable 72-74 degrees while gaming. In comparison my former EVGA SC2 Hybrid 1080 Ti would hit around 60 degrees while gaming and my iCX 1080 Ti would hit 77 degrees. However the card is pretty loud and the stock fan settings have the card constantly ramping up and down. The 2080 Ti series is a seriously powerful card with 4352 CUDA Cores and with screaming fast DDR6 memory. The card easily handles any variant of 1440P and at 4K is the only true 60+ FPS card with all settings cranked up. My system being linked to a SF600 isn't awesome for overclocking but I was a little disappointed to find out my card was only getting 1950 MHz. Overall not the best value but ones of the few 2 slot 2080 Ti cards that can easily fit in any system while running cool.",Joseph R.
"$1,229.99",This is what a flagship GPU should be,rating rating-5,2018-11-27,11/27/2018 5:23:06 PM,"Pros: Performance. Not just gaming performance, but also CUDA accelerated performance and machine learning performance. This GPU is a beast for both 4K 60fps gaming as well as any work loads that can utilize those CUDA cores ad Tensor cores. Power draw is pretty decent as well. EVGA did a good job in supporting this GPU. Mine was the first batch shipped with older BIOS. Then got a +30% power limit BIOS from EVGA forum right away, which allows the GPU to sit around ~1950MHz core when over clocked. I can go on for a while for the pros but you might as well read the reviews.

Something good that not a lot of review sites mentioned though:

EVGA offers a free trim kit after you register the GPU.
Precision X1 gets very good support. I see new versions coming out almost every 2 weeks.Cons: This specific cooler is not as beefy as the XC Ultra or the FTW3. The card does gets fairly hot (~85C) when both core and vram are overclocked.

Althouth EVGA is really committed to support Precision X1. I would not recommend using it to overclock or set fan curve, at least for now. Many bugs still need to worked out. Wait until X1 gets to at least 0.5.0 version.

The last con is the lack of RTX applications. I haven't found much use for the RTX engines on the Turing silicon.Overall Review: I use this GPU for both my gaming need as well as machine learning based applications. The small 11GB VRAM does limit the usefulness of this in ML applications quite a bit though

Overall if you want the best in gaming and also happen to be a programmer this card will serve you will. Personally I am waiting for either EKWB's MLC water block or EVGA's own hybrid kit. Putting the 2080Ti under water will more than likely curb the temperature issue.

As always, I will update the review once I have more time with the card. So far I am pleased with my purchase. This is what a top of the line state of the art GPU should be.

BTW: Take whatever being spread across the web of ""RTX are dying"" ""news"" with a truck load of salt. Remember, owners of functional cards tend not to be vocal. While the small minority who experienced card death may be way more vocal. That along with the echo chamber of social media can easily blow things out of proportion. I for one is very happy with my 2080Ti. And EVGA's customer service definitely gives me peace of mind as well.",Rui X.

Tried Asus's firmware update, more nVidia driver updates, run the DirectX update from BF4, underclock the card, nothing's helping. RMA'd the card, and a week later I'm up and running for round two. Runs great for a day, then the same problems return. I move this 2nd card to another gaming rig with a brand new EVGA 850W PSU. I do a fresh install of Win 10. After Windows updates to v1803, and installs nVidia drivers I start seeing funky anomalies in the video. Then it does the Win 10 version of a blue screen with an error that's referring to video problems. Pull out the RTX 2080 TI, drop in my Titan, and the PC is happy. On to RMA round two. Now where'd I put that shipping box?Overall Review: So, the third card came in. This one seems to be good to go. Several weeks of service now without failure. If you get a good one, you'll love it. I'd be sure you have a backup card on hand to keep you in service, and lots of patience. Make sure you hold onto your shipping materials for a little while before recycling them. Glad there's a 3 year warranty, but I miss the lifetime warranty nVidia cards used to have available.",Vincent H.
"$1,179.99","Fast, Small, and Hot",rating rating-3,2019-01-09,1/9/2019 6:47:59 AM,"Pros: - It's small enough to fit my Corsair 280X case with room to breath. Does take up more space than I thought but that's ok I can still access a few things I need so I'm ok with that.
- Configuration is easy and setup was painless.
- If the temps are too hot for your liking you can change the settings at least I have custom profiles for better fan curves and dial down the power input based on the temp. (It's insanely easy to swap profiles while gaming I haven't not had issues doing so when I want high FPS on BF5 for a little bit)Cons: - This card will sag it's heavy for sure I made a small prop up using some straws and electrical tape to give it a lift.
- Default settings with heavy load runs hot like instant 80C temps consistently.
- GPU Tweak will need to apply your custom setting on startup other wise it will revert back to default ""Gaming"" setting which will run hot. I suggest you install it and configure it to startup and apply the profile you want on startup.
- GPU Tweak OSD crashes some games and will close applications like discord when turned on. FYI their is a blacklist you can setup but it took me a little to figure that out so expect turning on the OSD feature to close your game or some apps running.Overall Review: - If you don't mind taking the time to setup a custom profile for lower temps sure.
- 100% power at 85C temp but I found it just stays at 80C while heavy gaming at least.
- I set 2 custom profiles one for 55% power at around 70C temps and another for 80% and 77C temps I find the lower one seems to work just fine for long WoW sessions. 80% does get loud and temps climb but it does it's job and I honestly don't notice a big drop in FPS running ultra settings. I've notice some weird sounds like a fuzzing audio is playing but I think it's just the fans they do get loud at higher speeds.
- Gaming mode is a power house and plays BF 5 great at ultra but will stay at 80C pretty much the whole time.
- The low db mode is nice fans don't run under temp threshold but only expect while idle and web browsing/watching youtube. Put any game on I was seeing roughly a low of 55C to a steady 64C - 70C climbs.
- I highly suggest you use GPU Tweak and configure a lower power input profile it's easy to configure and create profiles to play with and switch them is easier. At least you can control how hot and fast this card runs.",Jerrad Z.

"$1,179.99",Fun while it lasted :(,rating rating-1,2018-11-17,11/17/2018 12:00:26 PM,"Pros: Card performed great while it lasted.. Very high frame rates at 1440p! I'm talking max details with all the eye candy! Rainbow six siege ran 150-200fps most of the time, same with Destiny 2.Cons: When it worked it ran HOT, over 80c out of the box stock till I used GPU Tweak to adjust the fan curve. Fans had to be at 70+% to keep the card in the 70s (C), this made the card pretty loud all the time.

Now the card is dead, lasted a month and 5 days. Games started crashing within minutes (stock clocks) then artifacted heavily and turned my screen green. I even smelt a little bit of burning from the card afterwards....Plugged in my old 980 gpu and the computer is running great again.Overall Review: I just mailed the card today for RMA, hope it goes quickly. Once I have my new card and everything works fine, I'll come back and edit the review. Also this might not be on Asus, it seems lots of 2080 ti's of many makes are failing.",Ryan M.

- Binned chip, TU102-300A-K1-A1Cons: - Runs Hot, without a overclock it hit's 87C almost immediately in my case, starts to throttle down to keep temps at 87c
- Asus puts a sticker on one of the 4 screws as to use it like a ""warranty void if removed sticker"" but with no writing on it just a dot.
- 120% power limit vs 130% as other manufactures. Hopefully ASUS will have an update one day.Overall Review: - on water mine can reach core clock of 2095Mhz while hitting only 52c gaming and after about 4hours of hardcore gaming its only at 65c.

"$1,179.99","Best card, horrible cooling",rating rating-3,2018-10-25,10/25/2018 12:38:52 PM,"Pros: Although not the best benchmark I decided to play Fallout 4 everything on ultra @ 4k resolution with the game locked at 60 fps. This was with the card in its stock configuration in my full tower corsair with all four case fans running at full speed ambient room temperature 70F. Let me say card ran the game like a champ......for 10 minutes.Cons: Stock the two dinky little fans will only run up to 50%, this is why it overheats in 10 minutes. Fortunately I had previously heard of the issue and was closely monitoring it the temperature. With the Asus software I was able to keep the GPU cool, running fans at 80-90% and i'll tell you one reason Asus capped them at 50% because it sounds like an airplane is taking off in my house. So few hundred more dollars I water cooled it and now I'm happy.Overall Review: I love Asus and always have but I think they seriously dropped the ball on this one, paying top dollar and stock overheating in 10 minutes? Don't get me started on the packaging for this 1,300$ graphics card that now has no Asus parts on it. I should give it a 1 star because the only good part is the Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Ti",Anthony C.

- Huge performance on 3440x1440
- Runs cooler than the reviews I have read (74 Celsius stock clock,mem, and fan curve)Cons: - PriceOverall Review: This top tier card could look better, and with all the bad reviews it received I wasn't sure I made the right choice when I ordered it. Most people on reddit say they have the card at 85 Celsius without adjusting the fan curve... I don't know if they have good airflow, because all I can say is this beast never went over 74 Celsius in Benchmarks (Furmark, Heaven,etc.) on stock Mem,clock and fan curve... All I can say is I am happy with this purchase, and I'd recommend it if you want an RTX 2080 ti, and don't need RGB, or want to pay 200 more for the strix edition.",Antoine B.
"$1,179.99",Immense power... with some quirks.,rating rating-3,2018-10-04,10/4/2018 1:58:13 PM,"Pros: - Boom diggity doggy, best GPU to date. And yes, its powerful.
- Runs any game i have at max settings brilliantly on my 1440p (2k), 165hz monitor. Need at least 150 FPS in games to have them look great on this monitor, and this card delivers.Cons: - No heat pipes, just a large heatsink.
- Fans are not as powerful as they could/should be.
- Comes stock OC, yet for some reason also, the fans come stock unable to spin faster than 50% of their maximum spin potential.
- Stock out of the box was exceeding temps of 86C in Path of Exile within 5 minutes of play. Unacceptable.
- No LEDs, doesn't say Ti anywhere on it, for some people this matters, I dont see my PC innards so I don't really care, but it does seem silly for a $1250 video card.Overall Review: - You have to download GPU Tweak II or (another program?) to allow the fans to go to 100% speed when the card gets above a certain temperature. I was very worried when i got this card originally because of the temps, but I WAS ABLE TO FIX the problem using their GPU Tweak II. This is unacceptable that the card would come stock with this setting.

It was set to only have the fans start spinning @ 50% of their maximum speed when the card reached EIGHTY degrees Celsius, never allowing them to even spin at 100% speed. Once I fixed the fan speed issue, I could run Path of Exile @ 69C stable. (all settings maxxed 1440p, the game has no frame limiter so its pushing 250-340fps, thus why it was overusing and overheating the card). Rocket League runs at 53C stable. Acceptable.

This seems completely ridiculous for such an expensive video card, especially considering this is a model from one of the most reputable companies on Earth. Get your game together, ASUS.",Michael H.

"$1,399.99",I returned mine due to pump noise.,rating rating-3,2020-04-11,4/11/2020 5:14:11 PM,Pros: EVGA allowed me to return the card.Cons: I had a 1080ti EVGA hybrid card and loved it. I decided to upgrade to this card when it came out. I had to return it due to the pump running at 100% all the time. It was very loud. The noise was not coil whine.Overall Review: I plan to upgrade to a hybrid 3080ti card if EVGA can fix the problem of loud pump noise that plagues the EVGA RTX 20 series hybrid cards.

- Cool: The AIO on the GPU keeps temps low. After heavy testing, peak temps reached 61C. After gaming for about an hour, peak temps were 53-55C. Mundane use temps stay near idle at 30C.
- Quiet: The AIO keeps the hottest part of the card cooler, which means it's quieter. I'm using a push/pull for the radiator, and sound is audible under heavy load, but not excessive. The memory and VRMs are air cooled by the card fan. It is unnoticeable as far as noise.
- Stable: Due to being cooler, the frequency stability is excellent. With no overclock and 130% power delivery using EVGA Precision, the card stabilizes at 1985Mhz with peaks at 2010Mhz.Cons: - Price: Obviously an expensive card.
- Initial coil whine and noise: The pump was audible for about the first half-hour after install, but has been quiet since. There is occasional coil whine, again more after first install, but not much since.
- RTX logo on the side has EVGA logo LEDs underneath it that do not match up with the RTX logo. It looks like a poor implemented design that was added as an afterthought.
- RTX: Not much going on with this as of the time of this review, so purchasing a card for RTX is a gamble.Overall Review: I bought this card from another vendor because Newegg didn't have it at the time. I am coming from a GTX 1080 to this, and the performance improvement is drastic, sometimes +100% increases in certain games and benchmarks. Overall, at 1440p I can generally max out settings and keep framerates above 100fps.

The card is very expensive, but if you are looking to purchase this, I would recommend. Water-cooled GPUs are almost always better than air-cooled GPUs with respect to stability, noise and temperature.",Adam C.
"$1,399.99",The right choice for me.,rating rating-5,2019-05-30,5/30/2019 2:01:44 PM,"Pros: Easy install and positioning, The usual position for the radiator is the rear exhaust fan position on most cases. Very easy to do and replaces that fan. Originally I was going for a non hybrid. After much research I found that people with Hybrids were very satisfied.

I have run this card for two weeks at 4k resolution or just under and it stays very cool - under 60 c- usually just at or over 50 c. I have not overclocked it so I can not report on ultra super settings. I just use the max settings in most of my games and it handles it without a hitch.

The VR port is a definite plus.

As you can see I am very satisfied at 5 out of 5.Cons: The card is about 1.2 cm longer than expected. Measure your case.

There is separately sold adapter that moves the power plugs from the front of the card to the inside edge close to the disk stack. If you have a small case this adapter may not fit. Measure your case.

The only real con is price.Overall Review: While the only real con is price, this card is well worth it. The performance is as expected. Hybrid is definitely the way to go. I hope Nvidia improves and expands their use of Hybrid cooling.",fred b.

When your desktop is idle the fans power on and off rapidly when it needs to cool down. It does it in fast bursts and makes a clicking sound.,Dhonn L.

Received replacement for defective unit very quickly.Cons: My first order was defective and died after a few hours of use.
A lot of reviews seem to imply that the quality of these GPUs is not very consistent.
It's wider (along the x axis) than expected due to the protruding backplate and bulky fans, so make sure you double check the measurements for your case.Overall Review: If you have time to risk the possibility of having to send a defective unit back for a replacement, this is probably one of the best-priced 2070 Supers you can find.",Jonathan K.

- Low operating temps.
- Zero issue install (I did use DDU).Cons: - Only one thing: some coil whine. If it wasn't for that, it'd be a 5-egg review.Overall Review: My coil whine is very minimal and mostly (90%) goes away after the PC's been 'on' for 5-ish minutes. If you play with headphones or with loud settings, you won't notice. Also realized that putting a tiny bit of pressure on the card makes it go away. Would consider placing a foam block in but again, the coil whine is very minimal for me so I'll just leave things as is. Will not RMA the card over this.",Joel G.

I'll be looking into getting a different card when I have time, but for now this has been very disappointing.
2 stars because it looks nice and they were able to resolve the issue with the game codes eventually.

- The Gigabyte Aorus Engine pushes the limits of the boost clock to 1975 Mhz
- Good construction and does not sag much at allCons: - Coil whine
- Coil whine
- Coil whineOverall Review: Manufacturers need to look into sourcing parts that push the frequency of coil whine outside the range of human hearing. All electrical components have""whine"" but somehow most of them don't make noise like GPUs do.

So far I can run The Division 2 at 1440p High settings at a 99FPS average. The fans never get above a low hum. Far from noisy. It looks great paired with an Aorus motherboard. The only RGB is in the Gigabyte logo on the spine of the card. The only real issue that I've encountered is that when my monitor turns off after a time, it will not come back when using DisplayPort. My GTX 1070 and RX 570 do not have this issue with the same monitor and cable. This may just be a driver issue though and far from something that would stop me from buying this card again.",Matthew B.

$699.99,Nice replacement for Dell 1070Ti,rating rating-5,2020-02-06,2/6/2020 8:27:52 AM,"Pros: Made about the same level of noise as the Dell turbo 1070Ti board it replaced. The RTX-2080 super made an immediate %50 improvement for time to complete on the scientific apps I run., I selected Gigabyte due to my experience with their warranty program.Cons: The rear of the board was tapped for mounting a ""locking paddle"" and the holes lined up exactly with the Dell paddle holes. Unfortunately, the screw size was far smaller than what Dell used.. Gigabyte should have included a note as to the type of screws to use. I am guessing M2.0 or smaller and will have to order an assortment of small metric screws with a large head or use fender washers to mount the dell locking paddle.Overall Review: This was a replacement for an existing turbo board and has been running 24/7 no problem. It is a basic design with no flashing LEDs",Joseph S.

- Like the style; black with accents. No RGB or leds.
- The priceCons: - Maybe, the backplate not being solid metal, but it well made and sturdy. I dig it.
- Does not come with accesories, but most wont provide, much less at this price point.Overall Review: -It is a great Gpu, if you can get a discount coupon and manage to get a few games out of it; the price will be incredible. Totally worth it.
-Have had several brands before, all presented issues at some point. Never had a problem with this brand. All Rtx had issues on their first batches from many manufacturers. Its maybe just the word of mouth that does more harm than good. I would say wait for revision and patches or fixes on the brand you like, none of them are perfect. All items I had from this brand had had continuous revisions, which means they are paying attention.

"$1,269.99",Amazing Performance...poor quality assurance,rating rating-2,2019-02-27,2/27/2019 7:47:25 PM,"Pros: The 2080 Ti is no joke when it comes pushing pixels. Anthem - 3440x1440 - Ultra Settings and HBAO+ - Anywhere from 70 to 100fps (Gsync Monitor Refresh Cap)

Shadow of the Tomb Raider - 80+ Ultra Preset Benchmark result

It is a capable card. Build wise, the Strix looks clean and I noticed no issue with sag on the PCI E Slot.Cons: Two Issues:

Coil Whine - As soon as I installed and fired up, a noticeable coil whine note. This is not unheard of, and I decided to not RMA right off the bat; I wanted to play some new games on the horizon, like Anthem.

Drive Hangs/Crashing/Instability: Left the card at factory clocks (Left in Game Mode with ASUS GPU Tweak II) These symptoms took about a week, maybe two, to develop. I have been traveling quite a bit for work, so my gaming time has been reduced, but still managed a few marathon sessions once Anthem released.

Starting around the 24th of February, card purchased around the beginning of February, I started noticing more and more in game frame hangups; never looked at the event viewer logs to see if the driver was stopping and recovering, no errors were generated at the desktop level. I chalked these hitches to the software, Anthem has been plagued with performance and server instability itself. Eventually this behavior resulted in full on crashes, and eventually a hard crash out of Windows (no BSOD).

I encountered through Direct X errors, all referencing Driver hangs, bad calls, texture calls, etc.

From here I moved to troubleshooting mode. It seemed, through googling and searching the Anthem forums/reddit, that I was not the only person seeing these, so I started with the game first. Repair, Uninstall/Reinstall, Direct X runtime repair/reinstall, Drivers, etc. No luck, so I switched gears and started looking to prove the card faulty. Downloaded Heaven DX11 and 3DMark for DX12 - They both test differently. No issue, or at least no crash or apparent artifacting during the 3DMark tests. The Heaven DX11 tests however revealed that it is indeed an issue with the card. Reminder, this card is running as is from the factory. I had one successful pass on Heaven, but noticed artifacting, I would describe the appearance as oil on water blotching all over the screen. On the second test, a hang, the third, a crash that could be repeated and predicted at the same segment of the benchmark. The only troubleshooting at this point I did, and I still planned to RMA, was clocking the card down on memory and gpu; 500MHz across the board. This did not have any impact on the artifacting or crashing in Heaven.

GPU temps reported through Tweak II showed thermals well within limits on the silicon; peak temp was 74* C


TLDR:

Coil Whine from Factory - worsened over time and during max load on the card was fairly audible
Eventual instability and crashingOverall Review: I went into this knowing the risks with the RTX lineup of cards. Read around, ASUS is not the only board partner facing this issue. In fact, I still trust ASUS and will continue to use them for my other components, MOBO, Monitors, etc.

If you push forward with purchasing, look at the reviews around me and know that you might get a lemon. If you do purchase, I hope your luck was better than mine.",Jacob C.

"$1,269.99",Seemed to work.. until it didn't,rating rating-2,2019-01-08,1/8/2019 5:51:36 PM,"Pros: The performance on this card is amazing, fastest consumer graphics card on the market.Cons: After checking the other reviews on this card before posting this it seems that I'm not the only oen having these issues. Most games would have stuttering, no matter the title. Games crashes and the coil whine.. oh man the coil whine is HORRIBLE. It was a little strange that the coil whine started a few weeks in though.Overall Review: When paying 1,500 dollars!! I expect the card to work FLAWLESLY. Seriously? I honestly couldn't believe I was having these issues, thought it was a defective card, but after looking at the other reviews, I'm starting to think otherwise. I have RMA'd my card and with the new one one the way I'm PRAYING that this one doesn't have the same issues. I hoestly don't recommend buying this card right now, if my replacement works fine, I'll try and update if I'm able to. I have always went with ASUS/ROG components and peripherals (upgraded from strix 1070 card) and so far no major issue until now, sadly. Please ASUS.. look into this.",ALEKSEY K.

$684.99,8 Months in. Great purchase even considering the price drops in the market.,rating rating-5,2019-06-11,6/11/2019 5:17:04 PM,"Pros: -Runs as fast as the benchmarks online said it would. Great value purchase for 100+ fps on all titles (that I've tried) 1080P medium/high settings.
-I hit 144 fps on a lot of older titles I enjoy, as well as some newer ones like Apex Legends (1080P medium), Divinity 2 (highest, with some drops during explosion effects), and ESO (medium).Cons: -It gets really loud when the fan kicks to max settings, but this almost never happens and it normally doesn't last long (maybe 10 seconds) so I didn't remove a star.
-It's very large and heavy compared to the R9 280 I upgraded from, so if you have a small case check the dimensions.Overall Review: Happy at $230 with $30 gift card deal. At 180-200ish or so this is an easy purchase.",Eric A.
$684.99,"Perfect for 1080 gaming, overkill for office work.",rating rating-5,2019-03-23,3/23/2019 8:07:29 AM,"Pros: Will run most titles at maxed @ 1080 60+fps
Much more powerful, cool, and quiet than the 370 it replaced
No need to tweak stock settings unless you ""need"" to squeeze a few more fps.Cons: 0Overall Review: Got in on sale for $239 which was my target price. If you have a case with poor ventilation, you'll want to create a custom fan profile (MSI afterburner) but you knew this because it is an AMD.

Much better value than what the competitively priced competition offers. When compared to a 1060 6GB it performs on par, slightly better in some titles, a little lower in others, but there is isn't the screen tearing with the 580 on the same hardware plus CPU usage tends to be much lower running those same titles; %15 less on average. It has always bugged me that Nvidia offloads to the CPU, but that is a way to build cards that have lower power requirements, lower thermals as a result and over inflate performance.

After a few months now I can say it was a great purchase especially for the price. It is on par with a Sapphire 590 in Fortnite and PUBG at the same settings. I manually set the fan curve for gaming to go to 75% once the card reaches 60C and hardly ever does it make it to 70C at that fan speed even after a multi hour session.

People who have heating issues aren't dissipating heat soon enough and/or have poor case ventilation. Set fan curve to be more aggressive and it'll never have to run at 100%",Dale M.
$684.99,Great card. One of the best RX 580s.,rating rating-3,2019-01-06,1/6/2019 2:50:36 PM,"Pros: - The card runs cooler (thick heatsink) and bit more powerful then most other RX 580s.
- It's binned chip, so there is chance that you can get a really good overclock-able Golden Edition GPU.
- Looks great in a red/black build.
- Game bundles (AMD is killing it on their game bundles). I got 3 games free (including Odyssey) and I paid $240 before rebates.Cons: - Golden Edition has higher power draw because its OC to higher frequencies out of the box.
- It can occasionally run hot if you do not have good case fan set up.
- Rebate for $20 never came in. Tracking on Power color shows rebate was approved, but never sent. Very disappointed. Trying to get hold of Rebate folks, but there is no reply. Taking 2 eggs of the rating for this.Overall Review: It's a good 1080P card for all modern games, and if you tinker with settings, you can play many of those games on high on 1440P. I was able to get 100FPS on Black Ops 4. I could play Forza 7 on 4K at 60FPS on High settings.",Kartikeya P.
$684.99,Awsome For The Price,rating rating-5,2018-12-30,12/30/2018 5:30:52 PM,Pros: The Red devil works great runs flawless. It does run cool because of the huge thick heat sink on this card.Cons: Puts a lot of heat into the computer case so you need a case with good air flow. The card also takes up 3 card slots because i got the RED DEVIL Golden.Overall Review: I would recommend this card to anyone who has the space to put it because it takes 3 card slots. The card will fill the case with heat but the card runs cool. I would suggest a good air flowing case.,Sharon H.

Mine scores in the 83rd percentile for RX580's on Userbenchmark (likely thanks to the factory overclock).Cons: Does take up 3 slotsOverall Review: It went on sale by $50 after I bought it, but my Citi card comped me the difference.

$684.99,Not as good as reported,rating rating-2,2018-11-11,11/11/2018 2:51:25 AM,Pros: frame rates etc.Cons: COIL WHINE. I can put up with coil whine but this one is stupid loud. The bright side is that the fans ramp up to sound like a small aircraft taking off so I can't hear it anymore.Overall Review: Crashed immediately upon use. Clean install. Went with AMD to try and give them another chance after MSI caved to Nvidiots pressure and stopped the gaming tag for AMD. Have an MSI 1060 Gaming X in it's box and I think I'll put it back and use this in an HTPC. What a disappointment.,Ian P.

Really not much going on at the product site.Overall Review: This is a beefy card, feels substantial. I've had my Devil for almost a year. I have 2 way and 3 way crossfired using this card as the master. As to a review further up saying 2 couldn't fit. I have run 3 RX 580s in my Crossfire VI in a Cooler Master case and 2 were fine, I did use a relocator for the 3rd card because socket was covered. I like the look of Powercolor's render.

Sure its ""available"" but pricing due to the cyrpto craze is outrageous. this card is 85% more expansive than the Mfg. suggested retail a year ago. I'm waiting for pricing to come back down to earth. When Crypto mining crashes and it will these cards will be a dime a dozenCons: High priceOverall Review: just wait.

The bios switch gives extra protection for flashing; you have a backup bios if you mess up

Sluggish on most games with settings higher then low med.
Every week seems to be a new issue with card, have to download a new driver. Support sucked at best.Overall Review: I bought this card for a small gaming rig. The first week after build and many different driver downloads they card worked great for about 3 hours, at which time started to flicker. The card then froze up, multi colored lines across the screen. After several hard restarts the display came back. Support told me it was my HDMI cable, which it wasn't, so i bought another one, the one support suggested, few hours in froze again. Several hours and days of research on google come to find out everyone having same issue with this card. I was told a fix was to set the wattman to 50, after reverting back to last driver. I did, hour later crush. and all setting went back to default. I was told to disable Updates and MSI afterburner. again no luck. Called support again and got nothing we can do, your card is fine attitude. After several more days of tweaking and downloading different drivers i actually got it to work for more then 3 hours on a game. But would still crash. Normal browser had no issue. watching 4k movies it would flicker, watching 1080 movies would flicker from time to time but not as bad. Even youtube videos would crash it after awhile. Now i am stuck with a paper weight. DO NOT BUY unless you plan on just browsing the net \ NOT A GAMING CARD",Jesse H.

-free game and game pass w/ purchaseCons: I've only had it for a month so I cant honestly say I've run into any cons just yet.Overall Review: so I built a pretty budget PC and had a buddy give me an EVGA 2GB 750Ti card to get started before I made a choice on the GPU for it, it is a decent chunk of the cost when building a new computer.
after a fair bit of market research, I decided on this awesome card, its a great price. unbeatable in terms of value, super easy to install, worked before I put the drivers on and works great with my MSI B450M Gaming plus motherboard. running Doom or Outerworlds on ultra graphics with just the MSI software quick options was awesome, super quiet and still haven't pushed my GPU usage past 40% yet.
in all honesty, this has to be the hands-down best GPU in this category.

Read other 1-star reviews. Seems not to be a Linux issue.Overall Review: This was my first Linux Gaming PC build. The GPU was defective out of the box but took me months to determine thru various troubleshooting. Knowing that Linux-gaming has it's hurdles, I thought it was a configuration issue. I tried multiple distros, installing latest vulkan and dxvk, and tried both propoetarty and open-source drivers. I finally decided to borrow a friend's GPU that even required more power and it worked. I determined that it was not an issue with my power supply and that the GPU was no good. I experience the same as a lot of the other 1-star reviews. The screen goes blank and I have to reboot. IT seems to occur randomly but mostly when running a game. It sometimes happens just when browsing the internet or watching YouTube. I can't return the card to NewEgg. Hopefully MSI will hlep me out when I call them tomorrow.

If they are not accurate they have no value. Documentation that came with the card was woefully inadequate. The website was extraordinarily poorly thought-out.

$159.99,MSI Radeon RX 570 8 GB OC Graphics Card,rating rating-5,2019-09-26,9/26/2019 2:43:45 PM,"Pros: - Price - with the sales and the rebate, I picked this up for CAD$160!
- Performance is awesome at 1080p - runs everything in high to ultra!
- Cannot be beaten for price to performance - if you are on a budget, this is the card to get.
- 8 GB VRAM means you can run high graphics, textures and ENB's etc. with no issues.
- Low power/noise at idle/everyday computer useCons: - None really so far.
- I had to contact MSI directly after submitting my online rebate claim - that said, after contacting them it came through quickly. The speed of the customer service means I still give them 5 eggs.
- The bundled games were not my type (WWZ/Div2) so they'll never get played, but those offers change.Overall Review: - Totally recommend this card for the budget conscious/restrained. Cannot be beat unless you have a lot more cash to splash on a GPU.
- Undervolt the card through the Radeon Wattman facility in the drivers. Solves most of the noise/heat that people complain about without any loss of performance! Totally safe!!

No backplateOverall Review: So I was looking for the ultimate budget card when I made my first build, and this is what I found. At the time it was going for nearly 170 dollars and was comparable in price to 4 GB models.
This card does what it is supposed to do. It playes games well at 1080p60, and you can crank up the settings decently far before you run into drops below 60. You can even max out a few titles if you want.


It is clear the cooler is quite cheap as there are parts on the front of the card still exposed while there is no backplate at all. \The MK2 addresses this but the front part of the cooler still doesn't quite cover everything.

This card runs a tad warm, and the stock fan curve is terrible, at least if you max out the power slider, which I'd recommend. It has to ramp up the fans to 3000 rpm at otherwise stock settings to keep it at 60. You can turn it off though and set a much less aggressive one. Mine run at roughly 1700-1800 RPM and keep the card under 70 degrees, usually sitting at mid 60s under load, 70 being the peak it hits.

I recently saw an 8 GB RX 580 from Sapphire with a backplate and a nice cooler for less than what I paid, and it normally goes for 180. I'd highly recommend spending a little bit more money on a nicer card than cheaping out this much.
However, if your budget is that tight, and you need a solid 1080p card, this is the one for you.",Alder M.
$159.99,broken AMD reward game code,rating rating-1,2019-07-29,7/29/2019 12:09:22 PM,"Pros: the card worksCons: I bought 3 different AMD graphics cards, received 3 different game codes, and none of them work. Tried using all 3 codes with all 3 graphics cards installed using the AMD product verification tool and get the same response for all 3 codes. Something about coupon code limit reached. I think their verification tool doesn't work properly either because I have to change my password every time I try to log into it. It just keeps rejecting it, like they have a communications problem or they're just giving out fake codes. AMD garbage!!Overall Review: fraud business practice, using fake or used codes to sell your product",Steven H.
$159.99,Locks up frequently,rating rating-1,2019-07-21,7/21/2019 12:18:37 PM,"Pros: Reasonably fast and lots of memory for the price.Cons: I built two identical computers and after a few weeks one of them started locking up with a gray or black screen. The lockups happen randomly and don't seem to be related to GPU load since they have occurred when just browsing the web or sitting at the desktop. I swapped GPUs between the two computers and the issue moved with the GPU so clearly the card is causing the problem.Overall Review: It's nice when it works, but it's not worth the risk of getting a bad card.",Steven C.

$159.99,What a Performer for the Price!,rating rating-5,2019-06-27,6/27/2019 1:47:14 PM,"Pros: - Very affordable
- Huge performance for the price point
- Radeon offers substantially more configuration options than NVIDIA
- Came bundled with two awesome games that almost make up for the entire cost of the cardCons: - A bit more power hungry than most GPU's of its caliber (most likely for the 8GB of GDDR5 on this puppy!)
- Absolutely nothing elseOverall Review: ***NOTE***: This goes out to all of you people who keep having the ""black screen to freeze"" or ""freeze and forced to hard boot"" or ""PC shutting down"" issues. I had the exact same issue, only I did a proper troubleshoot before leaving a negative review. ***IMPORTANT***: CHECK YOUR POWER SUPPLY. This card uses slightly more power than a typical GPU. Everyone says they have tried everything without success, yet NO ONE MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT THE POWER CONSUMPTION. If your power supply is less than 600-650W, you are going to need a better one, hands down. GPU's only use as much power as they need in the moment, depending on the load. The higher the load (ie. playing a graphically intensive game vs. checking your e-mail), the GPU uses more and more power as it is needed. If your power supply doesn't have enough power for the GPU while it is handling heavier loads, your power supply shuts off because you have exceeded the ""ceiling"" of how much power is available . That is your PC shutting off, not the card.

TL:DR - Make sure your PC has enough power to supply to the GPU before bothering MSi with an RMA and leaving a nasty review. The cards aren't DOA, the people using them are. Learn some basic computer knowledge and logic before automatically blaming them!!!!",Zachary D.

I used it in a brand new system, ordered all the other parts on Newegg, everything else works fine... but this card... Had to replace it with my old one from my old system. Quite unhappy with this product.

I was having issues with my PC freezing up with the screen locking up into a single colour and buzzing. I spend a lot of time diagnosing the problem and eventually RMA'd the video card, only for them to return the card without addressing the issue. I'm now on RMA number 2.

The 2 free games are NOT free. You have to create an AMD account, download some spyware to start. Then, create a Uplay account and install the Uplay launcher to redeem ""The Division 2"", and create an Epic account and install the Epic launcher to play ""World War Z"".

It has now been nearly 6 months since I bought the card and still I have not got the rebate. I do not believe that the supplier of the card has any intention of paying any rebates, it took much time and effort to fill out the rebate, what a waste of time, it was not good enough that I bought online but I had to fill in forms again go online go to the post office etc etc All for a measly $20 never again, do not be influenced by the rebate,The supplier will not pay you it is only a marketing ployOverall Review: Yes I would recommend the card but again don't be influenced by the rebate from that supplier",Michael K.

I'll have to settle for a refurbished one since this item cannot be returned for a refund.
I hope the next one doesn't fail, as I have already been robbed of having a nice and new card, and I don't feel I deserve to be in a perpetual state of requesting a replacement.
Since this is a known issue with this product, and is still available with no clear solution or workaround, I would give zero eggs if I could (if it got my intended point across).

Graphic capabilities are good.Cons: This card ran just fine for about two weeks post build. Then started blacking out the screen and freezing the computer while playing video games. Temps and all other readings normal. Reinstalled drivers and was stable for another week until the same issues started happening again. Reinstalled drivers again; however, I choose the last 2018 driver release instead of the latest in order to help rule out driver compatibility.

Installed my old Nvidia GTX 760 and have not had a single problem since.Overall Review: As I was doing research on this problem I notice multiple people having the same, or similar, issue I was having.

Ability to control fans and over clocking with MSI after burner. Stays cool aslong as the fans are adjusted properly to handle high level performance.

Thank you AMD, and Capcom!:)Cons: Can be alittle loud with the fans but they work great. I usually don't use over 50% of the fan power when I'm not overclocking.Overall Review: Highly recommended, I can see myself buying another AMD GPU in the future.

- It'll do 1080p 60fps in any current game at medium or better settings
- A decent overclocker
- Reasonably quiet
- My Black Friday purchase came with two games, including Resident Evil 2Cons: - No RGB (if you consider that a con) and not very showy in general
- No backplate. Again, mostly a cosmetic thing
- No bragging rights, unless getting the most for your money is a status symbol with your friendsOverall Review: A lot of reviewers are touting the 570 as the frames per dollar king, and I totally agree. I bought two 570s during Christmas sales with the other one being the 4GB Gigabyte model. This one has the advantage of 8GB without much of a price premium, but the Gigabyte model is a nicer looking unit with RGB and a backplate. Both perform very well. I was a little put off by the substandard shrinkwrap on the box and the lack of a seal on the inner bag and wondered if what I got wasn't actually an open box. But I didn't see any evidence that it had ever been used like dust or small scratches on the contacts, so I decided not to worry about it. I was able to get a 15% overclock on both the core and memory with only a small boost in voltage, which puts this close to a stock 580.",Michael C.
$159.99,Very surprising little beast,rating rating-5,2019-01-25,1/25/2019 1:24:59 AM,"Pros: - Runs pretty cool in most cases. Highest I have seen it run was 74 C. When I really pushed it.
- Fans stay off until it reaches 60C, so the card is quiet. Even when I pushed past 70 the loudest thing in my PC was still my exhaust fan, which is fairly quiet as well.
- Performs much closer to 1060, which is far more expensive.Cons: - None so far on part of the card.Overall Review: - AMD should have given this card more attention than it did. in DX12 games this card performs admirably. Paired with my Athlon X4 950 this card still ran at 90FPS in Sniper Elite 4 with most things maxed out. I am getting an Ryzen 5 2600 in a couple of days so I'll see what it can do in games where the CPU won't be bottlenecking the card.
- Reviewers compare this card to 1050 and usually the 4GB version only. It shows the bias towards Nvidia by their community. I've found this card to be much closer to 1060 in performance. Specially the 8GB version of this card. In some cases this card lags behind 1060 by quite the margin but there are many results where it actually outperforms (DX12 titles especially).",Sergey A.

I had to send it back to Newegg to get it replaced. Hopefully they do so. I was having stutters, artifacts, blacking out, sometimes the graphics card would completely die on me and never recover until I reboot (only to have the same glitches again). I tried clean install of Windows, drivers, bios, NADA!. I even tried it on different computers, and it was still showing the same result. I concluded that the card it self was damaged. You win some, you lose some I guess. Hopefully the card that's replacing it, is a better one that will last me till I need to upgrade.

$159.99,32 Mh/s on a 570!,rating rating-3,2018-03-31,3/31/2018 12:52:15 AM,"Pros: Micron mem people say is bad, but I clocked it to 2225 without fail. Great performer but it took a ton of work to get it there.Cons: Power is tricky with this card. It only has an 8 pin so beware.Overall Review: Bought two of these. One failed. The other is a great. Runs cool 64c mining 32 Mh/s at 1250/850 2225/890. 3 eggs because one was horrible and the other is awesome. Micron memory is fabulous on this card. Outperforms my Samsung cards in an MSI rig. Needs 115w+ gold power to run good. Wouldn't put it on a spec power supply if I was gaming.",jeremy m.
$159.99,Defective Fan,rating rating-3,2018-01-29,1/29/2018 9:34:32 PM,"Pros: -I get 29.5 mh/s mining eth on 5 out of 6 gpus.Cons: -one of my 6 units has a defective fan. one side works, but the second side does not. I'm not sure if the problem is in the wiring or something wrong with the fan itself. The unit with defective fan can get up over 85C. Hash rate is reduced to 25 mh/s on average and it produces bad shares occasionally.Overall Review: -If I lay the gpu on it side, the fan spins at about half speed.

don't worry. I'm an engineer. I can do this carefully to diagnose the problem.

I think the problem is with the fan itself. There is no obvious problems with the plug wiring. The wires seem tight. The fact that it spins at half speed when on its side makes me think its a problem with the motor.",Thomas C.
