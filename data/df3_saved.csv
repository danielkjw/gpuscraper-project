Had to tweak fan curves to always keep the fans turning.  ","Overall Review: I would recommend for anyone comfortable modifying fan curves, and tweaking OC-ing or undervolt-ing  I used manual tuning for volt settings and tweaked the fan curve in Adrenaline 2020 and have not had any bad luck with crashes after under-volting. In this case I used 1.027mV with max freq 1950mhz and clocked the vram to 1850mhz, I created a fan curve to run fans at 50% for temps under 60c and then increase as it gets hotter.  I traded a little performance for stability and chip life.  Update, after 4 months of use: I wish i never went with this gpu and I should have went with similar nvidia. I tried patiently to wait for driver updates since 19.8.2, now we are on 20.4.2 still unstable. Black screens and hard resart, or Green screen and self reboot, or crashes stating error occurred in amdkdmap* or similar. I have tried many things, updated the psu and even reinstalled windows. Cant play games with any long missions knowing theres a high chance of crashing. If I put my older nvidia 1060 card in my system I can play for hours with no issues, so its the gpu. As a bonus, I found out the hard way it was not compatible with HP Reverb - screens would not power on, HP provided a firmware update due to how the AMD driver works, once again the HP Reverb worked fine with the older nvidia card but not the AMD. Now still having issue with the HP Reverb were AMD driver does not fill entire resolution of the display panels, so I have a VR device marketed for its high resolution but the AMD card cant feed it its native resolution, and again my 4yr old nvidia runs the HP Reverb fine full rez edge to edge.... facepalm.  “Get what you pay for” applies here.",2020-05-07 18:03:00

I wouldn't recommend this card to everyone, I enjoy tinkering with overclocking and problem solving and I recognize this card wouldn't be a great choice for someone who just wants to plug in a card and have it work 100% out of the box. That being said if you can handle a little bit of instability the 5700 xt is a beast for the price point- NVIDIA doesn't have anything that matches it. I'm running slightly OC'd at 2100 mhz as my card is unstable beyond 2120 and bringing it down a little more seemed to help with intermittent crashes. I haven't experimented with undervolting yet but I've heard good things so I mean to try it. The initial install of the AMD Radeon software was throwing frequent AMDRSServ.exe error codes but reinstalling resolved this. Reinstalling drivers also seemed to help with crashes, not sure what went wrong with the first install. In a mid-sized case with 5 fans (3 in, 2 out) seems to hold at around 70C under load with a side panel intake fan blowing almost right on it.. I know a lot of people have had problems managing heat but that hasn't been my experience. Personally, I would buy this card again. Whether it's worthwhile for you would be dependent on whether you value stability or performance. For the same price you could pick up a 2060 Super for a perfectly stable plug and play graphics card, or you could go with the 5700 xt for more power at the cost of having to optimize it yourself a little bit and a crash here and there. It's also perfectly possible AMD will figure out their stability issues and this card will become the clear hands down winner for the price point. My bet's on AMD.  Update: After owning this card for 3 months and tweaking its performance a lot more as well as applying the recent driver updates the card's stability has improved. I've stopped getting black screens and error messages while playing games since undervolting the card and applying the 2020 driver updates. Driver stability in general has improved, at least in my experience, and undervolting provides a couple fps performance loss for greater stability and even better thermals so I'm happy to do it.  Problems I still have with the card are when playing in modern games (specifically RE2 and 3 remakes) with Radeon Image Sharpening on, picking up an item (which automatically opens the menu) will sometimes crash the game. I've never had this problem with image sharpening off and it's listed in the known driver issues (as something along the lines of a ""task change"") so I'm confident this is the problem. The other problem is when playing graphically demanding modern games on one monitor (1440p) with another program such as chrome open on the secondary monitor (1080p) the game will sometimes crash or on rare occasion cause the computer to crash and restart. Issues with multi-monitor setups are also a known issue with current Radeon drivers.",2020-05-04 21:38:00

Stock outperforms the 2060 as expected. Mine scored in the upper percentiles of userbenchmarked 5700 XT's, and it destroyed 2060(S) by scoring 114%. OC pushes a bit more to about 117% and is line with a 2070, or a 2070S depending on the game. - Sleek design, I paired it with a x570 Gaming X and the RGB Fusion 2.0 works like a charm. The RGB gigabyte logo is nice, the backplate is nothing special but a nice blank aesthetic. Material feels great. - Stock temps are great, 70-85c under full load, Junction Temp hits 110c highest, which is within AMD spec. - AMD OC puts this card from 2070MHZ. to 2130MHZ. Gives me about 5-15fps depending on the settings. -1080p ultra on WWZ and Division 2 gets me easily 100+ FPS. Scored 11k on WWZ on stock. Can't remember Div 2.  ","Cons: - Card can run hot if you OC it despite insanely good airflow. There may be thermal controlling issues with my card as any OC runs in the 80s really fast, at 46% fan speed. - Fans can get LOUD. 50% fan speed has the fans going upwards of 3k+ RPM, and it is like you've got industrial fans in the computer. Not sure why even allow fans go that fast, and 3 of them at that. If you plan to OC, be prepared for a lot of tinkering and perhaps fixes to the card. -Noticed some flickering here and there, and has some compatibility issues with some apps (Yi Home)  ","Overall Review: Overall, really great card for the price. Beats a 2060S stock for stock, and I assume 2060S OC'd as well even on stock. Looks nice, and if OC'd is on par with a 2070 or a 2070S. No issues so far except for some momentary screen flickerings due to using OBS to record that only happen on boot of some games. Great card for someone who wants to plug and play. No driver issues.  However, if you're an enthusiast and bought this card to get the greatest bang for buck for OC, be prepared for lots of tinkering/troubleshooting. Thermals on OC take quite some time to get straight, and may require opening it up for thermal pad swapped or applying more pressure.  Build: x570 Gaming X, Ryzen 5 3600, Gskill 3600 CL16 2x8.

Gigabyte's card was one of the top listed cards along with the Sapphire Pulse. I went with Gigabyte due to the design.  Playing games it runs great and rarely ever does it have to rev up the fans to cool down the card. Then again I do not play for long periods and my computer case has three 140mm fans for intake and three for out.  Only problem I have run into with this card is when the computer falls asleep, the screen turns black as it should. If I wake up the computer right away the screen works fine. If I leave it asleep for about 5 min or more and try to wake up the computer, my screen wakes up most of the time with full red color or blue (not the same as Blue Screen of Death), it was green once. But the issue happens 100% of the time if left in sleep mode for more than 5min.  Have tried everything to fix this issue by: -Re-seating the GPU -Using different PCIe slot -Unplugging and plugging cables back in -Screen still comes up oddly colored after the computer boots back up -Downgrading PCIe version to PCIe3 instead of default PCIe4 -A forum said incompatibility between motherboard X570 with older CPU 2700X -Used different monitors -Still the same color when swapped out during that state -Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable -Used different cables -Still the same color when swapped out during that state -Still oddly colored after reboot with new cable -Updated Graphics Drivers -Downgraded Graphics Drivers -Updated W10 updates -Update AMD CPU and Chipset with Catalyst  Nothing I have tried has fixed the issue.

AMD is killing it with their CPUs, but their GPUs are lagging and this card is a prime example. The price to performance on paper is killer, but that's just the hardware. The drivers are a broken mess that have not been fixed since release. I've tried every major release from 19.10.1 to the most current driver and each one pops up new issues with new fixes (turn off many extra features, only use one monitor, etc). When paying 400 for a graphics card one should not have to turn off many of the features of the software or not be able to use a muilti-monitor set-up.  A quick google of any 5700 driver errors will get you countless solutions, and believe me I've tried them all: - New PSU (with a cable to each GPU power connector) - Disable XMP - Fresh install of Windows - Undervolt / downclock  Even with all of those changes, still crashes constantly when gaming across multiple platforms.

I was basically told that if it failed during stress test then return for a replacement if not than it was a driver issue and to contact AMD to see if there is another driver. I was running the most recent driver. I have been able to play other games with pretty good stability. This review isn't really a knock on gigabyte although their support didn't seem to do much.

It would get a maximum of 160 fps in games that are supposed to go up till 400 even.  CsGo is one of the examples. Literally lowest settings gives unplayable fps. Less than 60 fps and even that stutters. The weird thing is if i set settings to ultra it gives slightly more playable frames but still would drop to 80-90fps everytime i flick in CSGO.  I've tried tons of possible fixes (DDU, Fresh Windows install, etc), absolutely nothing works.

Where the problem lies is in the use of the thermal paste, i'm not sure if its the cheapest stuff they could get to save money or the application method (thinking a combo of both) but when you start to push higher resolutions while gaming and maxing out what the card can do the temps will start to rise uncomfortably high. My temps on resident evil 2 remake at 1800p, locked 60fps and the highest of settings saw the cards junction temperature sitting around 105c, which was a bit to much for me.  I had a tube of Artic MX4 thermal paste lying around. I decided to open up the card and repaste. What i fount out by doing so was that they used very little thermal paste, the application was not that bad but they just did not use enough of it, even if they did use a little more i'm not sure how much it would of help cause i'm pretty sure they are using the cheapest stuff.  After i repasted with the MX4, under the same settings and resolution in resident evil 2 remake the card would hover around 85c for the junction temperature, i say that is a pretty significant improvement over the stock paste which goes to show just how bad the stuff they are using really is.  So overall this is a great card if you are interested in a 5700xt, just make sure you repaste with something that will actually do a better job at keeping the card cooler under full load like Artic MX4, Noctua H1, Thermal Grizzly etc..",2020-01-21 23:02:00

Playing R6 Siege for example on ultra settings gets me about 180-250 fps on the rx 5700xt when I was getting about 100-120 fps on medium/low settings with my 1050ti. The card looks great as I have it synced with the rest of my rig with rgb fusion 2.0 and it couldn't be an easier install.  The one issue I have is that I use two monitors. The card has 3 Displayport and 1 HDMI slot. On my first monitor, I used the HDMI since it doesn't have a displayport slot. The second monitor, I have a displayport cable plugged into it since it does have the port for it. After Uninstalling all of the nvidia drivers and running ddu multiple times, I downloaded AMD's Radeon Adrenalin software and updated the drivers for the card to the most recent version as of 1/16/2020.  My monitor using HDMI has no issues with video output. The second one using displayport has very random flashing in the top right corner of the screen. It flashes and has lines and just glitches out randomly. I've tried Using a different displayport slot on the GPU and it doesn't change anything. I've also plugged the HDMI into this monitor and it works fine with HDMI.  I don't know if it is a driver issue or if there's something wrong with the brand new cable I bought for the card but I'd rather not have to buy a Displayport to DVI adapter. For now I'll live with the flashing since it's on my secondary monitor. Outside of the flashing, I love the card.",2020-01-16 14:41:00

If you're having stability issues with this card, make sure that it's getting enough power by plugging the 6-pin and 8-pin connectors in to different lines from the power supply, rather than daisy-chaining from the same one (especially if you have a <700W PSU).  2. If you're having trouble with thermals on the card, make sure that the air can exhaust from the heatsink properly, and try undervolting it from AMD's wattman interface.  3. If you're still having problems, make sure you don't have CCleaner installed. Somehow, that program made this GPU fail.  ---  I initially purchased this card back in August, 2019, when it was still brand new. I knew I wanted Navi since the rumors of it using the 7nm process began to circulate in early 2017, and the synthetic benchmarks from reviewers suggested that it would meet my hopes: AMD finally having an answer to Nvidia's years-long GPU dominance. My build had shifted a bit since the last AMD card I had, though; I went from a high-airflow ATX full-tower to an ITX shoebox; cooling, airflow, and space all require a bit more consideration.  When I first got the card, we had...issues. The card ran 15C warmer than I was seeing in reviews from GN and the like, and it was crashing extremely frequently. Upgrading the drivers in the rest of my system helped some, but ultimately, it felt like I might have gotten a bad egg. At least one BSOD a day told me that _something_ was wrong, but the symptoms were ambiguous and inconsistent.  I spent awhile focusing on the thermals, thinking that the warmth in the card was probably to blame. The card's cooler is built in such a way that the air exhausts out the sides, so I had to tune the fans in my case to account for the extra heat buildup. Even then, though, the thermals didn't come fully in line until I applied the auto-undervolt setting in AMD's wattman.  But even with the thermals fixed, I was still crashing.  That's when I found a forum post where someone else was having similar issues on an RX 590--and what resolved it was plugging the card in to two separate lines from the power supply. As it turns out, the power supply wasn't capable of delivering enough power over a single line to cover the spikes in power demand, and the card isn't built in such a way as to properly handle not having a glut of power available. Now that I've corrected this, and have each connector on a separate line, the GPU is substantially more stable--and runs MUCH better. These are the numbers I was expecting, and I'm glad to finally be getting them. Hat's off to AMD on making such an impressive entry to the mid-range market, and to Gigabyte for bringing such a great cooling solution to market, as well.  I'm sincerely hoping that AMD corrects this issue as they iterate on the Navi architecture and move beyond it. Spiking to 350W of power draw does not seem normal for a mid-range GPU, and while drivers and firmware updates may help to improve this, it feels like something that system builders shouldn't have to account for.",2019-11-09 12:01:00

The cooler is immensely underpowered, hardly managing temps even at its (ear-piercingly loud) highest speed. The drivers are intermittently problematic - I'll have weeks without an issue, then three crashes in a day. Generally I'll either get a driver failure that crashes the program in focus, or the screen will just go black while programs continue running in the background. The ASRock software is absolute trash - it often fails to open or crashes, and can conflict with the AMD tuning software.  ","Overall Review: The chip is wonderful, and the card is as advertised. Cooler is horribly weak. Performance is fast when the chip is cool. You get what you pay for; the cheapest version of a very powerful GPU.",2020-05-03 15:48:00

It will get a black screen and force shut down my entire system within 10-30 minutes into any modern game. I also get blue screens with the stop code ""video internal scheduler error"". I have gotten the blue screens while the system was just sitting in windows on the desktop not doing anything. Even while I was away from the computer.  I am not insanely computer savvy but I do know a lot, I've had my brother who is very savvy even working on this issue. Here are all the things we have tried: 1 - Updating video drivers, we have tried several versions(including the one from this month and the ""windows recommended"" one among them) in case an earlier one would work better, we always did a clean install and removed previous versions. - no version made any change 2 - updated vbios - no change 3 - downloaded the asrocks tweaker and adjusted fan settings - no change 4 - updated main bios - no change 5 - updated chipset driver - no change 6 - updated MB driver - no change 7 - windows scan for system file damage - no change 8 - fixed and cleaned registry - no change 9 - re-seating both video card and ram - no change 10 - turning off all vsync type functions - no change 11 - taking the side wall off of my case - no change 12 - upgrading power supply to EVGA Supernova 1600w (was using a 750w) - no change 13 - switched out monitor to brand new one in case of some random compatibility problem - no change 14 - complete format and reinstall of entire system twice - no change  These are just all the thing i can remember - I may have missed some. I have determined there is just something physically wrong with this card. The only thing that has made any difference at all is capping FPS to 60. Even that is not a complete fix it just means it lasts a little longer before you get a black screen and force restart. I really would like a card that would work. Thanks",2020-04-21 16:22:00

I'm not sure if the rattling sound is a defect or not, but since I already had to RMA once I'm hesitant to do so again. I'm kind of tired of waiting for the card to ship back and forth. Speaking of that, I did have to RMA this card once already as it was DoA.  Most of my cons are due to the driver software. I have numerous problems from the drivers that are infuriating. I want to mention them, but I won't deduct stars from this actual card for them as they're an AMD problem. Switching from a full screen graphical program to another program (alt tab to Discord from a game, for instance) tends to be slow and tear the display heavily. Minimizing or dropping focus from a full screen game causes massive stuttering on audio transmitted over HDMI while the full screen game is not in focus. There are random graphical flaws and tearing or texture blanking in a variety of games. None of those were present with my previous Nvidia card, and unless they are resolved in the near future I might return this one and get another Nvidia card purely for the difference in quality of drivers.  ","Overall Review: The card itself is stellar, barring a possible defect with the fans. I'm incredibly impressed by the performance. I do, however, hesitate to recommend it to my friends at this time because of the abysmal state of the drivers in my experience. Still, if you know what you're getting into with AMD drivers and are willing to tough it out while they fix them, you won't be disappointed with the hardware itself.",2019-09-24 06:57:00

I'm using the GPU on a BOINC networked project. I have upgraded my PCs for this purpose over the years. I currently have 6 GTX 1060s, 1 GTX 1660 and this RTX 2060 between 3 ROG PCs, 2 with AMD and i with I7 processor. Credit wise, on my chosen project, the GTX 1060 base does good. The GTX 1660 does about twice as good. This RTX 2060 does 4x as good as the GTX 1060!  ","Cons: Generates a lot of heat when fully engaged, which BOINC projects typically do. Some heat to the front of the card is blown upwards through a perforated vent over the heat sink front up/card back. This, unfortunately, puts heat in front of the CPU cooler. Added heat shield (well piece of tissue box cardboard) to direct heat to side of case. Turned fans blowing air in on sides to pull air out. Problem solved.

This new card ran hotter than the last one at stock settings, and was okay until it just died. No signal and boot loops the system.

But don’t really care if it runs quiter in efficiency mode since I’m blasting explosions and gunfire over it with my headphones. Don’t care about pretty lights. I’m not a kid. Freaking HUGE card. Fits nice in my HUGE case.  ,"Cons: From AMD’s website: Some Radeon RX 5700 series graphics users may intermittently experience a black screen while gaming or on desktop. A potential temporary workaround is disabling hardware acceleration in applications running in the background such as web browsers or Discord  This has been an issue since Oct 2019. However, I did try the 19.12.1 drivers last night. I used DDU to remove the newest driver. I installed the 19.12.1 without the GUI. Played BF5 for about 2-3 hrs with no black screen. Let’s hope this will last. And Lets hope this helps others because we know AMD sure won’t.  ","Overall Review: I would not recommend buying the card since AMD has taken no urgency in correcting their problems in providing a current working driver to their customers. It’s a shame they spend more time making a new, cluttered ,over stuffed, and impractical GUI and not focusing on their drivers. Their entire quality control dept seems inept as well.  AMD also thinks it’s funny not admitting it is a driver problem to all the customers who owns this card. Just search “RX 5700 XT black screen”. So many people are trying all these fixes and wasting time. They’re doing clean installs, buying new PSU’s. Messing with BIOS. Throttling back settings from default....list goes on...all while AMD sits back and laughs with their cruel joke of no disclosure. I will definitely go to the green side after this nightmare of a purchase.  Lastly. If I get a manufacturer response after this post please don’t read it. They don’t deserve anybody reading comments that helps defend themselves since it’s too late and you had your chance. See ya on the green side !",2020-02-07 21:31:00

As others have mentioned, the two screws adjacent the VRM are too long. This makes for poor or no contact with the heat sink. I replaced mine with two slightly shorter M.2 size screws I had laying around from an old laptop. There is also insufficient mounting pressure on the GPU itself. I added nylon washers to those 4 screws and my temps are insanely low for an XT. A very simple fix, just don't use excessive torque.  Star Wars BF 2 under 98% GPU load @ 1950+Mhz: GPU 60c Mem 67c Vrm 55c  This will probably void your warranty!! However, it is necessary for the card to function as designed.

I'm coming from an i5 5600K and a Radeon R390 so this is an upgrade regardless.  The card runs hot as compared to other cards, at least that's what it seems so in reviews. My experience with the card is that it does run between 75C and 85C with junctions from 95-105C with fans running between 2000 rpm to 2500 rpm. When it hits the top number of the fan speed it really gets loud. This occurs whether or not I have the side panel on or off, maybe a few degrees less. This is on Performance mode.  I did also update to the efficiency BIOS, and still runs on the hotter side, but then again my reason for obtaining this card was not to run it in the efficiency mode but to rather use it in the OC state. Other major thing is that it's advertised at 2010 mHz boost clock speed, which I've never reached in gaming sessions, only thing goes up to is about 1970 mHz at from what I remember. I do have a 750 Watt 80 Gold supply, so doubt its the power that's hindering this. My heatsink/block seems like it is attached well, and there is no major play, but still wonder why it's running this hot.  The rest of the issues are to deal with the AMD drivers, given that when it is on a light GPU game, the clock speed dips into the single digits and there is stutter/micro stutter. Turned of AMD's freesync and all their other features, still does this every now and then, which is quite frustrating. On more demanding games, I don't see this as frequent.  Can't return this card unfortunately, only exchange it, and rather not wait for the shipping again if I don't have to, but if I could, probably would exchange it for another board partner manufacturer and see if that's the problem.  TLDR: Runs hot, AMD drivers still has issues, probably wouldn't recommend or buy again, but stuck with it for now, might upgrade to Navi 20 for the hell of it.",2020-01-29 08:44:00

Easy install/setup  ,Cons: Size  ,"Overall Review: This is a big card. It's loud, but it does what it says on the box. I really don't care about the noise, I like performance. Too many poor reviews based on noise alone - really, get a grip folks. This card is fast, it benchmarks well and in terms of frame rates is right up there with the 2070. I was always an Nvidia fan, but after getting the R9 390 and seeing the performance vs price difference, am firmly in the red corner for a while. I did not have any issues with drivers or setup, though I did undervolt it as many recommend. I don't play a lot of games, but I do use an oculus rift. Arma 3 on ultra is kicking out 240+ fps. Xplane 11 is around 30fps due to the OpenGL platform, but it works well enough that it's not choppy, and has decent level of world objects and HDR. All my other VR titles are smooth as can be on max settings. It runs around 65C under Max load in my system, I did notice that my system fans are working harder to expel more heat, but that's as designed so no complaints so far. Will update if there is any changes.  i7 6700k @ 4.4ghz 16gb ram 256gb SSD Asus ROG hero 8 main board.",2019-12-26 05:55:00

Since changing over it has been one thing after another, and I cannot figure it out. I maintained core clock speeds perfectly on the old 1070, but this thing is all over the place. It maxes out the VRAM while the core clock hovers between **700-800mhz** just running in Apex. If in a fire fight and swiveling very fast, the frame rates drop significantly, screen delays but no artifacting, and then the PC crashes. I can provide screenshots and data logs, but no option to attach pictures. On my 1070 I could set a core clock, and it maintained that clock speed while gaming. I cannot deal with these clock speeds dropping hard, boosting back up, and then dropping again. PC Specs: R7 3700x, Asus Prime Pro x570, Corsair 2x8gb 3600mhz, and all latest BIOS/drivers installed. The worst part is I cannot get a full refund to go back to Nvidia. So disappointed because I had such high hopes for this card.

(5700's, 2060's) This performance range was almost HALF of these prices just 2 - 3 years ago!  ","Overall Review: My previous graphics cards (Arez Strix Vega 56, Strix RX 480/580 OC) are still being used in my household, and still play most titles very well. AMD finally seems to have an architecture that they can scale well. The performance uplift is much more eye-popping than it was going from the 580 to the Vega. I just recently sold a R9 380(XFX) and I still have a R9 290(ASUS). I fully expect to have this card as long as I have had the 290 (2014). I would definitely recommend this card over the RTX competition. More performance for the money, AMD chips are generally supported much longer, and in my option, the picture quality has been noticeably better going back to ATI days.

The card should just work and AMD has failed to deliver solid drivers that allow their product to work. I didn't want to spend way more on a 2070 Super for marginal performance gains but now I will because of this experience.  The card is very large and might not work for all cases and setups.  ",Overall Review: I think Sapphire did a great job on this card but I blame AMD for making the cards dysfunctional. YMMV but read the reviews and Reddit on these cards.

","Cons: UPDATE: Initially, I received a defective unit.. it had experienced frequent screen blackout/disconnects, occurring at random, and nearly made my computer unusable. (it also comically reported over "" 725C junction point"" temperature, which is not possible since that's well over 1,300F and should have pulled a flaming Nvidia, but it didn't burn anything and wasn't too hot to touch). HOWEVER, the replacement unit has been working flawlessly!! So I still recommend the 5700 XT.  ","Overall Review: UPDATE: With the help of Sapphire's customer service, we determined I received a defective unit initially, but I was able to get a flawless replacement quickly through Newegg. So I updated my 3-star to a 5-star rating since I don't experience screen disconnect nor any other issues with the replacement 5700 XT, and it can run current games super smooth at their highest settings, rendered beautifully in 2K resolution @144hz for a fair price compared to its competition. Other Thoughts: They recommend a 600w PSU... I have a high quality 1050w power supply with plenty of airflow and minimal power vampires (no excess lighting/devices/gizmos, etc.). So, for would-be upgraders, please don't try to blame hardware if you're stressing a budget 450w PSU and have poor airflow.",2020-04-12 13:00:00

This card seems much better built and have had much less issues. There were some difficulties however. - Upon booting into RDR2, the fans were a bit loud, but not intolerable. I looked at temperatures and while the main GPU temperature was completely acceptable(Mid 70's) the junction temperature was 105-110c. While AMD has said this is normal, I felt the Delta was unacceptable and far too high. I disassembled the card to replace the TIM with thermal Grizzly Kryonaut, After which the Delta between the GPU and Junction temperature typically is about 13C and the card is much quieter. This suggests a less than optimal TIM application, though the factory spread seemed satisfactory, so perhaps a lower quality TIM? - After TIM replacement the card has been great, though with the same bugs and issue AMD has had for quite a while now. I believe the drivers are the main cause of having difficulty controlling fan curves. Whether using Afterburner or AMD software, it doesn't work properly. Sometime's it does nothing, and sometimes it just doesn't work properly IE set at 30% and it goes to 39%. And it does not seem to allow a fan speed under 30% unless it stops the fan completely. This allows my computer to be louder than it was with my previous card that allowed the fan to spin all the way down to 15%(450rpm). ------------------------------------------ After having the card a few weeks, I have found that there ""more power tool"" allows me to change the minimum fan speed, allowing me to lower it all the way down to a reported 10% in Radeon software, which is 13% according to Aida64. This equates to a RPM of 449 reported, bringing it into the inaudible range. This brings the card at idle into the range I aim for, which is dead silent. The give you an idea, the computer is MUCH quieter than a 5400rpm hard drive, and the loudest thing in my room now is a toss up between my backup monitors ""hum"" or a LED bulb that has a similar hum.",2020-04-02 21:00:00

RGB lighting looks good and the card overall is visually appealing. Junction temps haven't breached 80 degrees yet. The overall value for the frames and textures I'm getting is great.  Update 3/9/20 - I have now had a few crashes while gaming. One was heat related as junction temps soared over 95 degrees C. I dialed the voltage down to ~1130 mv and bumped the fan curve up just a little bit. Seems to have helped a lot. Fans are still much louder than a typical NVidia 10 or 20 series card. Still like the card a lot especially paired with a 27"" HDR capable monitor running at 144hz. Colors and textures are amazing.  Update 3/20/20 - So after more gaming and tweaking, I seem to have found a sweet spot in the processor curve. Set the upper limit to 2010 mhz and keep your voltage at 1125 mv. Adjust your fan curve to where there's approximately a 40-45 degree curved incline after the card hits 50 degrees all the way up to 100 degrees. This seems to be the best compromise between peformance, stability and fan noise. Also, I have found that games crash much more frequenly when the performance metrics overlay is enabled. Overall still pleased with the card b/c its still the best value for QHD gaming. If you have the money the 300 extra dollars for the Asus 2080 Super Advanced ROG Strix card is worth the money because it's stable out of the box and is much quieter.  ","Cons: Fans can get a little loud once they rise above 50 percent. Some random crashing, almost always when performance metrics are tracking your FPS and GPU temps. Trixx software was crashing consistently in version 6.8 but the latest 7.x version does seem to be stable.  ",Overall Review: An excellent value at the current market sentiment.

You must install the lastest version for it to work with the RX 5700 series, and that latest version has no fan, or overclock controls, or any control for that matter at all aside from RGB. I was very disappointed in this, and the response from Sapphire was that they may be bringing features back in the future. On the plus side MSI's Afterburner program works perfect with it, and works great so problem solved.  ","Overall Review: Card performs great with a few minor glitches that need to be worked out in the drivers. One being that having hardware acceleration on it Discord can cause it to black screen the display when loading games for extended periods. I have no need to have hardware acceleration on in Discord so I just disabled it. The high temps and such that you see some complaining about only exist if you leave the stock fan settings, and stay on the old drivers. After the most recent update, and my fan curves in place I see no more than 45 C in most of my games with Satisfactory (very graphics intensive on all ultra settings) managing to push it to about 62 C on occasion which is still very healthy. I got Borderlands 3 free with it which is plays on max settings amazingly on my 1080p display.

The RX 5700 XT, in general, is a fantastic GPU for high refresh rate 1080p, or great 1440p play.  As to the card itself, it's very nice. The design is quite good, with a relatively clean look that's not the standard drab of black and red. The included ARGB is very tastefully laid out, and the inclusion of an ARGB header to allow the lighting to be tied to the motherboard's control, or a separate hub, is very appreciated.  The three fans in use a quite large, and as such, are very quiet under load. The card is near on silent under heavy load, and isn't noticeable at all compared to the rest of a regular system. They also do a great job of keeping the card cool, and all my GPU temps were very under control with the stock fan curves.  ","Cons: Despite that ARGB header, Sapphire decided not to include an ARGB cable to tie it into your system, which is frustrating given the price. That being said, the ARGB can be controlled via the Sapphire TriXXX software, which is rather light and simple.  As a note on that software, you'll be required to install it to switch the ARGB to external control. Again, a minor frustration, but the software doesn't run constantly, and can be removed after making that one change.  Finally, the card is big and heavy. That does mean it stays cool, and looks good doing it, but I'd recommend a GPU support of some kind to alleviate any sag you're likely to see after a few years.  ","Overall Review: This is, by far, the best RX 5700 XT you can get today.

They had a recommended loadout for every game I played on my GTX1070. I'd always tweak the settings after Nvidia set them, but it was a great place to start. AMD runs a benchmark and then recommends turning down AA and post-processing effects. Doesn't even explain what those do. GeForce Experience listed every game setting and defined what each setting did using pictures so you could inform yourself and choose what was important. -AMD ReLive, the recording software, just isn't as reliable as Shadowplay. I grew to love recording and cutting together highlight reels. The AMD recorder causes random stutters and may crash the game if you alt+tab. Even when it is recording, it often doesn't respond to my hotkeys for saving a replay.  ","Overall Review: Newegg doesn't accept returns on open boxes, so be careful. It took me hours of troubleshooting to get this card working right. If you're upgrading from an Nvidia card, you can't just uninstall the old drivers and install AMD drivers. You have to do a wipe in safe mode with DDU (display driver uninstaller). You also need to have the most up-to-date drivers for your motherboard chipset. You can't get these from your motherboard support page, you need to get them directly from Intel or AMD. These steps got my card working 98% correct. I no longer need to force a restart because the screen went black. Games no longer crash. The in-game overlay works. The only problem I'm still having involves my monitor. Sometimes a low resolution will be set when I boot the computer and the only way to fix it is to unplug the monitor's power and reconnect it. Restarting or unplug/replugging the displayport does nothing. The drivers and software are still poor, but at least things work. I owned eight Radeon cards before the GTX1070 this card replaces. I was excited to come back to the party, especially with Sapphire. I planned to run this 5700 for my standard 2 year period. Now I'm thinking I'll trade back to Nvidia come summer when the new lineups launch. I'm sorry, Sapphire, your card is great. The software is making you totally uncompetitive.",2020-01-10 06:45:00

I don't have any issues with the card although buyers should be aware that this card doesn't come with any installation disk, software or drivers. Fact is Sapphire passes that to AMD who doesn't have any special driver for this particular graphics card. AMD has a one size fits all software and driver for the 5700XT card and it doesn't matter which brand . This card works with Windows 64 bit Pro version that I have but when it comes to Linux, AMD has avery limited support and after trying several times to install the driver, I got soap and running Linux without a graphics driver is lame considering the cost of this particular card. Any driver is better than no driver so I went to the Nvidia website, yes, they have linux drivers that actually install but you have to try on a hit miss basis until you get a driver that works with this card. I am impressed with the card, not impressed with the support or lack of it as Sapphire needs to step up or push AMD to provide better and more than it presently does. For the linux fans, be sure to check the specs, the support and lack of it before buying this card or any AMD based graphics card as this isn't new with AMD, its old and getting older.  ","Cons: I'm not a fan of the RGB software as I'm not impressed with colored led's, fireworks or light displays which does nada for better graphics on your monitor.

I'm taking an egg off because there is NOTHING that explains the 3 way switch on the card and the support website is nothing more than an advertisement. I figured the switch out after some testing but still Sapphire you should provide that info. Also this card is not compatible with MSI afterburner which had been my go to tool for oc for years. The trixx software for this card has no clock or fan settings. The only software for oc or even setting a fan curve is the amd driver that is broken right now. This probably is an amd issue not a Sapphire one but I think it's relevant.

Super appreciated that this guy is silent, even when it is ramping up it isn't anywhere near the 'leaf-blower' cards. - RGB : if its your thing, then this card looks absolutely sexy in a case. I personally love it, though I did have a hard time trying to install the drivers to manually control the lights - Performance : easily handles anything at 1080p, though that's not why I got it. I wanted to get great performance at 1440p! Which, so far, this card has tackled anything I've thrown at it. Easy 60+ at highest setting, with a few hitting 120+ with a bit of graphics tinkering.  ","Cons: - RGB : Its a bright card! Again not a con for me, but could be for others - Size : This is one long boy! If I had a radiator in the front of my Meshify C, then this wouldn't fit. It barely does with just the front intake fan! Granted, doesn't affect me, and proper measuring will avoid this issue!  ","Overall Review: So I have always been ""team green"", but this is mainly due to the just overall lack of performance/dollar of ""team red"". But alas I just cant support the specific ""fruit"" company styled marketing that green team has been screwing the consumer with for too long. The 5700XT is a great card. If you want to game at 1440p high setting 60+ fps, then this can handle it. I had a 240hz 1080p monitor for all the first-person shooters, and it was buttery smooth! But recently upgraded to (thanks black friday) to a 1440p 144hz monitor and things are just as smooth using this card.  Fans run quiet even under load. And when system is idle you can hear a pen drop! This is super appreciated as I have had way too many ""jet engines"" in previous systems. If aesthetics are your thing, the sleek look, rounded edges, and two tone color looks is clean and fits almost every build. Then throw in solid RGB that isn't overkill and gives the card some class.

Some of the items were loose and moving about in the shipping box, but to be fair all the build items were undamaged and worked on first boot. Finally the card was more expensive when I purchased and shipping wasn't free. Newegg definitely has the best deal with free shipping now but it doesn't hurt to be a little proactive since Newegg doesn't have their Price Match Guarantee on this product.

My Vega was great but it definitely wasnt a plug and play card, it was a overclocking enthusiasts dream and it was always fun to play with but lacked stability (even from stock settings). This Sapphire card on the other hand was simple, I plugged it in and that was it. There wasnt anything I could do to even squeeze an extra fps out of this card. I mean, usually you can overclock a card out of the box and get a tiny bit more perfomance out of it, but this Nitro plus was perfect so huge thumbs up to the Sapphire team. The attention to detail in the card is great too. They actually use separate heat sinks for the GPU chip and the memory modules so the chip doesn't heat soak the memory, very smart. It has a dual bios switch (performance and quiet) on the card itself, but also made it switchable in their software, so if you want to switch bios, you dont have to go into your pc case and click the switch. Both of the bios option perform well, with the performance option gaining 2 maybe 3 fps on average for me. So if you arent a hardcore gamer, the quiet bios should be fine if you like a quiet computer. Over all, I have no complaints, and since I went from an AMD card to another AMD card, it was just a matter of plugging it in to my mother board and boot up.

There's no better feeling than opening a new triple A game and cranking every setting to max at 1440p and still getting well over 100 fps. The looks are not bad, and the cooling is above average compared to other 2080 ti's. The fan noise is not bad at all. The fans idle when not under load, making it silent during web browsing, video streaming, etc., and are a very reasonable, non obtrusive volume when under load.  Unfortunately, it takes ends up 4 slots once you account for the much needed (and provided!) support bracket. And, as everyone else is pointing out, the price hurts.

Happens completely randomly. You could be gaming, stress testing, creating, watching Youtube or simply sitting idle doing nothing; might last you 4-5 hours, might not last you 5 minutes until it crashes. Even sometimes crashes before the MOBO is able to successfully boot into windows. Doesn't matter the current load or temperature. Never even bothered OCing due to the card constantly crashing. Colossal disappointment. Transplanting the card into my other systems sitting around the house resulted in the same pattern of random crashing. Tried installing previous driver versions hoping it would just be simple driver issues that could be easily fixed with rollbacks but the crashing persisted regardless of the version of drivers I installed from Nvidia.  Large and heavy, using the included support bracket is almost necessary but unfortunately takes up an additional 2 expansion slots directly under the card, so I wouldn't recommend it for systems built for SLI/NVLink or systems running additional add-on cards. Card is also very long and on my ASRock Z390 Extreme4 covers up 6 of the 8 SATA connectors on the MOBO; so make sure you attach your necessary cables before installing the GPU.

Had to switch back to my GTX1080 so I'd at least be able to use all the new hardware I purchased. Since swapping back in my older GTX1080 I've not had a single crash.

I always buy MSI's premium cards. I like the bang for the buck. Pro's for the 2080 Ti card? Don't know . To busy cleaning up the mess MSI decided to bestow upon me by failing ship the card with a complete package inventory.  ,"Cons: Driver disk was NOT in the package when I opened my packaging for a $1,350+ card, so, I called MSI service. The fellow on the other end of the phone tried to tell me the card didn't ship with a driver disk, yet clearly the inventory sheet inside the packaging indicates there IS a driver disk. He went to check, then came back and told me yes, he could ship me a driver disk but I would have to pay $10.00 for shipping. I told him I don't buy a $1,300+ GPU and then pay an extra $10.00 for the driver disk that should have shipped with the product in the first place! This is kinda tantamount to blackmail to get an extra stinking ten bucks. Really?.  ","Overall Review: Yes, I am totally aware that I can load the drivers over the Internet. That's NOT the point.

still going strong! it still hasn t died yet seriously though that s one of my biggest concerns and i m sure of a lot of people when considering buying this gpu so much reports out there of these 2080tis dying i m happy to say that mine hasn t and haven t shown any of the reported space invaders error artifacts etc in fact the only crash i ever got is when i was oc ing this gpu and was easily resolved by just lowering the oc despite having the dreaded micron memory that a lot of people claims to be the culprit of these gpus giving errors or dying that hasn t happened to me i was able to oc the memory to 800mhz but it wasn t stable enough so i downclocked it 750 which it has been running all this time without giving me any problem even though the memory is micron and not samsung i ve read reports of people also with samsung memories dying crashing etc so its kind of hard to just blame it on the memory i have upgraded from an asus strix 1080ti oc edition which i m very impressed with and has served me good when i was gaming at 3440x1440p 100hz acer predator x34 on an ultrawide display but i have upgraded to a 4k 144hz gsync hdr monitor acer predator x27 which is the main reason i upgraded to a 2080ti it s hard to point it out but i can definitely feel a qualitative increase in my overall gaming experience after upgrading to a 2080ti versus my 1080ti it s not so much on the fps but the overall experience seems much smoother and more solid don t get me wrong my 1080ti is a beast too in performance but i feel its more rough around the edges and more prone to stuttering micro freezes compared to a 2080ti at least in my case it can run almost every game at 4k 60fps mostly higher but that depends on your setting almost every game i played i can run on ultra or maximum settings and still be about 100 fps this includes resident evil 2 remake dead or alive 6 devil may cry 5 jump force etc metro exodus on the other hand is around 60 80 fps on almost max settings dlss can boost the fps but it seem to make things more blurry so i don t like using it on metro exodus i ve read they might have upgraded the dlss implementation on this game to make it better but i have to check again this gpu has very good build quality and feels very solid in my opinion this must be the 2nd best looking 2080ti with rgb implementation the first being gigabyte aorus 2080ti extreme with its dazzling spinning rgb fans i was even thinking of getting the aorus at first but the reviews shows it doesn t really do a good job on cooling the gpu another thing is for the rgb fans to look good the fans has to be spinning at 60 rpm so if you have the setting where the fans don t spin if the temp is low enough it will look like cr4p not being to show off its spinning rgb fans my temps has been very decent max is around 72 75 c when i m benchmarking gpu torture test but around 62 c 70 c on normal gaming with an ambient temp of around 78 c in the room these are temps inside a closed case if i open it up the temps will be much lower i wish reviewers of gpus will do more test using the gpu inside a case than on their open case test bench with their ac in the room in full blast coz if not their reviews on temp is pretty much useless to me oh btw these temps are also using the default fan setting when i tweaked the fan settings to run the fans at 40 60 rpm depending on the temp the gpu never exceeded 70 c and was usually just around 60 64 c and at this fan setting it was still pretty much silent as as i said above i have no problem with the fan noise i left it at default even though it makes the gpu run a little bit warmer i mean the max temp for this gpu is around 88 c and it has never ever reach that high even when i m running loops of furmark for hours on its default setting highest was 75 c for coil whine noise i ve never heard it at all during regular game play during benchmarking though if i put my ear close enough to the case and intentionally try to hear for it i can hear a little bit this is mostly during my fire strike time spy benchmarking this noise is very minimal and i have to deliberately get my ear close to the case to hear it it s nothing like the high pitched coil whine of a psu or those old amd radeon cards it s more silent this gpu is freaking expensive like titan class expensive i own a lot of nvidia gpus and some amds and i can t wait for intel to enter the fray and make these gpu prices go down or maybe amd s navi would do some miracle and overthrow nvidia s top gpus but i doubt it i ll go for whoever has the best price performance on my next upgrade i m just kind of forced to go for the 2080ti for now since its undoubtedly the best gpu at the moment if you don t count rtx titan and coz i needed a 2080ti to run my 4k 144hz gsync hdr monitor like the previous reviewer down below me here in newegg i hope i don t jinx myself writing this review and make my msi 2080ti gaming x trio die on

happen to me but we ll see only time will tell if that happens you can be sure that i will update this review including how msi support handling of the case hopefully though it doesn t come to that this card is huge make sure your case can fit it in before you buy it i have a corsair 780t and it fits just fine also this gpu uses two 8 pin and one 6 pin power connector make sure your psu has the cables and voltage capacity to support it this card will most likely require you also to use a support bracket this package comes with one use it i used mine along with an msi gpu bolster google it and its just perfect no sag at all with this set up msi didn t use more quality parts on this gpu compared to their upcoming lightning 2080ti aside from the extra 6 pin power connector which is pretty much useless coz of the power limit every other part used seems to have been stock for the same price point asus and gigabyte claims to use more quality components i been holding of on writing this review for a while now i want to make sure i possibly done all i can to make sure i didn t get a defective one that will give me those notorious space invaders errors then die i have put this card on several gpu torture tests in loops i ve been running this gpu oc ed all this time 110 oc 750 mem up to writing this review and so on it hasn t given me any indication of dying so far my pc system is running very stable overall then again i do take good care of the software part aside from the hardware i make sure my drivers are always updated and no conflicts os updates installed hdds not overheating and no smart errors and the occasional cleaning of temp and trash files that the system will no longer use i also run defrag on my hdds yes it does help msi at this price point i wish you guys have used more quality components on this gpu there are no mention of your often claimed military grade components on this gpu at all while asus and gigabyte claims they used better components than the stock nvidia uses well i guess its all good as long as it doesn t die on me but tell you what i have an msi motherboard die on me before and when that happened i never touched another msi product for 7 years this gpu is the 1st msi product i purchased after 7 years and i buy a lot of expensive hardware and write a lot of long honest reviews everywhere online and also talk about it a lot not only online but also with my co workers and fellow tech enthusiast if this msi 2080ti dies on me before the 3 year warranty and msi doesn t handle it in a manner i m satisfied with you can bet

I'm happy to say that mine hasn't and haven't shown any of the reported space invaders error, artifacts, etc. In fact, the only crash I ever got is when I was OC'ing this GPU and was easily resolved by just lowering the OC.  *Despite having the dreaded Micron memory that a lot of people claims to be the culprit of these GPUs giving errors or dying, that hasn't happened to me.

The boost clock speed is one of the highest no FE card. Could easily achieve 4K 60 FPS amount most triple A title games at very high settings  The MSI afterburner gives easy control over the fan speed, auto overclocking (ctrl+f for the scan)  The thermal performance is also great, the fan rpm is about 41%~50% when playing high demanded game, the temperature never goes up to 74, and it’s still quieter than my Aio fans at 1300 rpm. (Sadly my card have coil whine sound even louder than the fan noise)  ","Cons: This size of this card is also one of the largest 2080ti among the market, it come with a support, but it would take about 5~6 pcie slot. So would’t fit in small case or even some mid-tower case. But fit perfectly in my H700i  The most disappointed thing about this card is the coil whine sound. Ever high-end card could have that sound if the clock speed is high and fully loaded, but this one is just too loud to ignore it. Would help with the headphone, the high frequency coil whine sound made by capacitance could easily penetrate headphone. I’m not sure whether only my card is the defective one or it’s a design problem, but I have initiated the RMA for replace, hopefully it would work.

you are paying premium that s a fair warning but still you pay what you get for not only better performance but also new technology such as rtx and dlss deep learning super sampling requires at least

manufacturer s specification to ensure that the graphics card will fit inside the case whether it s mid tower or full tower chassis limited rtx games support requires windows 10 october update version 1809 including dxr api to benefit rtx feature requires decent cpu and faster ram speed to prevent bottlenecking gpu make sure to download latest and greatest geforce driver 411 70 or newer at geforce website the rtx 2080 ti is by far the fastest consumer graphics card in 2018 as you can see it runs very quiet fast compared to gtx 1080 and gtx 1080 ti in terms of gaming performance i was running around 200fps in call of duty wwii which felt very smooth responsive and fluid yes i am using acer predator xb272 240hz g sync monitor when it comes to overclocking i personally like msi afterburner

simply overclock in one click without a hassle to avoid potential artifacts especially driver crash for temperature wise i was getting about 50c 65c on average depending on ambient room temperature speaking of aesthetics i was very impressed that msi listened to customer s feedback in regards to red accent shroud which not everyone is a big fan of red color scheme since the msi gaming x trio rtx 2080 ti comes with mystic light rgb then it makes sense to remove red accent shroud to compensate and balance the color tone of their rig regardless number of peripherals that uses rgb such as creative sound blasterx ae 5 pcie sound card including led strip g skill tridentz rgb ram etc for those customers who are concerned about price point the rtx 2080 ti is specifically designed for

resolution rtx on the other hand impacts visual fidelity and greatly enhances in every part of the game such as ray traced reflections ray traced diffuse global illumination ray traced shadows ray traced ambient occlusion variable rate shading etc thankfully more major titles have been announced at gamescom 2018 which supports rtx as well as dlss such as shadow of the tomb raider battlefield v metro exodus final fantasy xv pubg playerunknown s battleground you name it note that some games may support rtx only while some games may support both dlss and rtx like shadow of the tomb raider for instance but all in all it was absolutely worth it to upgrade from gtx 1080 to rtx 2080 ti hopefully in the near future i would like to see more rtx games announced in 2019 such as resident evil 2 re

On an all AMD system, here is a basic walkthrough of what I had to do to make this work: • Download & update your UEFI BIOS • In your motherboards UEFI BIOS - select Gen 3 as the operating mode for your PCI-E slots • Perform a clean install of Win10 - be sure you downloaded the latest build • Download & install the latest chipset drivers from AMD - restart windows • Download & install the latest graphics driver from AMD - restart windows • Download & install the driver for your monitor (if available) or setup a custom profile in the AMD Radeon Software for your monitor - restart windows • Select the correct monitor resolution and refresh rate through Windows Display settings • Set powerplan to AMD optimized - if you didn't install the chipset driver or opted to not install the power settings, the next best thing is choosing 'performance' as the setting • check power settings, make sure windows is not set to to put the monitor to sleep • tweak settings & re-tweak settings  Above I said you could use the performance power setting - I do not recommend this. While gaming in performance mode - the system will randomly crank up the power draw, increasing the system heat, & then the fans ratchet up to absurd levels. I recommend installing & using the AMD power setting. I won't provide the plan details - I expect that deeper settings are also modified under the AMD power plan.

My first ever GPU was a RX 480 and it will continue to be my current GPU until I find something actually better. I have nothing but BEAUTIFUL words to speak about the RX 480 because that card in my eyes is perfection. I wanted the 5700 XT to be a STEP UP rather than a step down. I've used the card for 3 days and I have to say that I'm not impressed. I use a RYZEN 7 1700X and play on a 1080p monitor with 144hz and I've thrown a lot at the 5700 XT. I've played Apex ,Division 1, Division 2, Battlefield 1, COD:MW, Borderlands 3, Red Dead Redemption 2. Out of all of those games red dead 2 impressed me the most because it was a much more silky smooth, pure eye candy and a complete enjoyable experience when comparing the RX 480 especially because of freesync. I TRIED playing all these games on high settings, anything higher would result around 60 FPS. The thing I don't understand is the benchmarks on the internet that everyone has done with this card and the results I'm getting. The frame rate is way better in the tests. I manage to get around 110 FPS on high with a lot of the lighting details, ambient occlusion and so on turned off or all the way down and half the time the frame rate isn't even stable. It will jump from 100 to 65 and mostly stay around the 80's. I understand it WON'T be stable and most games are not optimized well but that's a huge drop on 1080p by the way. I've also made sure that EVERYTHING is up to date from radeon drivers, to my chip set drivers, to the bios and windows. Also my computer did freeze twice in one day but I did have a windows update and I believe that fixed it.  In the end the RX 5700 XT on paper should be a great upgrade and I was really hoping it would but in my experience it was just underwhelming. Maybe I just didn't get a good card. I'm not saying I don't recommend the 5700 XT, just saying maybe do some research and be mindful before pulling the trigger to those that consider this card.",2020-04-11 18:11:00

Make sure you can tell the difference.***   Anyway, as of the end of Feb. 2020 this is a completely stable card. I am having no driver issues, no mechanical issues, and no install issues. This thing is fantastic. It seems like the driver issues are a thing of the past. The only problem was that it looked like someone dropped this card because the shroud was bent and some of the cooling fins were detached. I did take the card apart, not down to the thermal paste, but the whole shroud and repaired it. The card is beautiful and fully functional so far with absolutely zero cooling issues. I am using Radeon drivers 20.2.2 with no problems at all. I can push this card to the max and it asks for more. Make sure when you get your new Radeon Navi card to do a CLEAN install of the Radeon drivers. I selected ""factory reset"" when I installed my new card and drivers. No green screens, no black screens, no problems or glitches of any kind. Just a dam good but OPEN BOX graphics card that is a little physically scarred.

","Cons: - So far, no cons for the GPU itself, as it has improved my FPS by almost 25-30%.  - However, AMD driver software still needs some improvements, but I will not deduct eggs for AMD's mistakes: - Optimization of games seems out of the user's control - GPU stats (temp, FPS, clock speed, etc.) displayed during games is optional for the user, but its overlay takes up too much space in the right corner of my screen. - Some of my games (i.e. Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Shadows of War, FarCry Primal) all crash for no reason, and I can only attribute this to the drivers and software struggling to optimize graphics for my system.

My entire build has an AMD footprint, so now everything seems to look, feel, and play better (despite the AMD GPU driver software needing some improvements).",2020-01-05 13:50:00

Usually about half an hour into a game, the graphics card would crash and each time I would try the game again and a different game and the system would crash, and it would get progressively worst. I cleaned the drivers using DDU 3 times, installing Radeon software 19.12.1, 19.12.2 and the latest one 19.12.3. All 3 times games have crashed. I couldn't even load Ghost Recon Breakpoint without it crashing instantly. I wanted to give Radeon cards a chance but it looks like I have to go back to Nvidia. I tired everything I could from turning everything off and turning the settings to low, but at this point what is the point of playing the games on low setting.  ","Overall Review: I don't know if this is a driver issue like what everyone on the forums have come to complain about or if this is just a bad card, but this has been a very frustrating experience for me.

Watch a youtube vid or two to get things running right. No issues with drivers or crashes. With the right configuration I am averaging close to 80 FPS on 2560 x 1440p. You can also use TRIXX to get a simulated 1440p and boost your fps to average 100. I love the card.  ","Cons: If you use it right out of the box, the fan curves will blow real loud once you start tweaking the overclock. This is fixable, however, so not a big con. Something to consider - This card is tall so it might interfere with an expansion card placed right below it. Fortunately the only other thing on my motherboard is a firewire card.  ","Overall Review: I had 0 issues with installation or crashes or black screens. I'm using an AMD 2700X on an Asus Crosshair VII Hero motherboard with a 650W Corsair power supply.

Wait, it fits in a mATX case. There's one.  ","Cons: The 5700 XT is plagued by driver problems. Spend a few minutes browsing around for 5700 XT system hangs, restarts, sleep mode, etc. The user community is still pretty small which makes the amount of people having problems a large percentage. Tech support is hopeless. They act as if this is something unknown or new, or worse, they're just incompetent and clueless. Zero communication with the user base - which is basically a bunch of gaming enthusiasts with varying degrees of technical abilities.  A 30 day return policy is a joke if you're building a system from scratch. Even if all the parts arrive at the same time and you're really quick at building systems. If you run into problems and need to return something, like a motherboard, or THIS CARD, you will only get one chance. Shipping back to Newegg and waiting for the replacement will take at least a week.  Problems:  Sleep mode (which is not available in Win 10 until installing the Radeon drivers). Goes into sleep mode ok. Not coming out. Sometimes it does a full restart, sometimes tries to come out, but hangs, sometimes BSOD, sometimes ok. But it ALWAYS drops any non-system drives from Win Explorer if it comes out of sleep mode without hanging. Event logs show Event 157 - Drive X has been surprise removed. So, here's the solution for this problem: Turn off sleep mode and don't use it.  Plagued by random system hangs, restarts, BSOD. Windows event logs show Bugcheck 0x00000116, When the system is able to create a dump (which many times it doesn't), it always shows one or all of the following offenders in the dump stack: dxgkrnl.sys, atikmdag.sys, ntoskrnl .exe This problem has been going on at least since August 2019 according to the problem reports in the AMD community forums. AMD said the problem should be resolved in 19.9.2. Nope. Stepped all the way to 19.11.3, same problem still exists.  ","Overall Review: Not only would I NOT recommend this GPU, I recommend staying as far away as possible. The card may be fine, but it's impossible to tell because the Radeon drivers cause all sorts of system problems and instability. And it's repeatable every time. So far, I've rebuilt a brand new system 3 times with new/different components, and it's sadly amazing to watch a very solid system turn into garbage as soon as the Radeon drivers are installed. Every time. I can't believe these companies are putting this untested garbage on the market before it's ready. I'm not interested in being a beta tester. Actually, it's more like an alpha tester.",2019-11-30 12:44:00

Using this to change settings appears to be the worse way (ie. doesn't always work/apply your settings) and you may as well use the Radeon settings before you even startup your game because the overlay will most likely degrade the performance even after you close it.

The price and performance when compared to other models is top-notch. - Great Build Quality - Great Cooling (GPU Core and Memory) - Quiet in most circumstances - Dual BIOS - Heatsink fins are oriented length-wise, allowing it exhaust hot air out the back of your case. - Fans are easily replaceable.  ","Cons: - The fans can make quite a bit of noise, similar to my Radeon VII, if overclocking or pushing the power limit. - The backplate might not be for everyone, though it doesn't bother me. - Red ""SAPPHIRE"" LED cannot change colors or be turned off. - Sapphire TrixX software is nearly useless in terms of controlling the lights or fans on this model.  ","Overall Review: I've owned this for two months and I've decided to finally write a review. I gave it 5 stars because I've had no problems with the product and it's performed exactly as intended. Even exceeded expectation. It's cool, quiet, and performs brilliantly. Any problems people are having with this card usually come down to the iffy drivers that AMD has released thus far and therefore effect every 5700XT card, not just the Pulse.  Overclocking and Undervolting: I've been able to achieve 2100 MHz @ 1134mV Core (Stock voltage is 1200 mV), stable. Power Limit: 0%. Power Usage: 201W. Core Clock hovers around 2000 MHz while gaming. Pushing the Power Limit up even 5% achieves even higher clocks, but heat increases exponentially. I'm only able to overclock the memory to 910 MHz. Anything higher results in black screens. I don't know what memory chips my card has because I haven't disassembled the card. With these settings and good case airflow, the card ramps the fans up to around 2000 RPM, which is definitely audible. It's a bit unpleasant but with headphones on you shouldn't hear it too much.  Alternatively, I'd recommend undervolting the card instead. I've been able to achieve 2000 MHz @ 1060mV stable. Power Usage: 185W. Core clock hovers around 1940 MHz. This results in at least a 6°C lower junction temperatures during benchmarks and only a slight hit the framerate (2-3 fps). Because of this lower junction temperature, the fans don't ramp up as much, resulting in a less power hungry and quieter gaming experience while maintaining nearly the same performance as the overclock mentioned above.  Lastly, the fans: The PULSE's fans in my Fractal Design Define R6 (Tempered Glass Side Panel) case become audible at around 1500 RPM. At 2000-2200 RPM, the fans are easily the loudest fans in my computer. As mentioned above, it'd still be comfortable with headphones, but these fans get loud quick. If you want a quiet rig, ensure your fans don't exceed 1800-1900 RPM or so. The best way to do this is to have good case airflow and undervolt.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase. It's not the NITRO+ or Red Devil, but at this price it's a great choice if you're in the market for a 5700XT.",2019-10-09 19:00:00

There are constant graphical tearings, for example when playing Overwatch some of the models don't load, and the screen goes to black occassionally for a split second. At its the gpu will crash. This happened on the most ""stable"" driver of 19.7.5. I updated to the most recent of 19.9.2 and yet there are still issues.  Also if any of your applications use Hardware Acceleration you will need to turn it off. This means browsers, discord, autodesk, nearly any application in 2019 will need to be manually set to not use HA.  ","Overall Review: I am incredibly disappointed with this card. I went into this with an open mind. As this is a complete AMD build, I also went with an AMD cpu, which I have zero problems. In fact I probably will use AMD CPUs overe intel, they seem great.  But when it comes to GPUs, screw this. If I could I would ship it back and get an Nvidia. There is little excuse to be unable to play standard multiplayer video games. I am not trying to run anything graphically intensive. This is an absolute joke.",2019-09-13 20:05:00

The Heatsink design on the GDDR6 is ingenious..very happy with GDDR6 and VRM temps.  ","Cons: Bad thermal paste application on mine (see below - that's why I docked it an egg). Fixed. Drivers still relatively immature (not Sapphire's fault). Both are fixable (drivers on AMD, quality control on Sapphire).  ","Overall Review: First Sapphire card I've gotten in about 8 or so years. Was psyched when I saw the reviews, especially with thermals.  Got it, and was immediately getting mid 90's on junction - high 70's on edge temp and would hit 103-105C when I pushed the power limit to 30% or higher. Even at 5% power limit increase was high 90's junction. Mind you this was with the fans at full tilt.  I knew something was wrong, when comparing my results to the reviews. After a week or so I gave in, and tore it down. Applied IC Diamond 24K and put her back together. Junction temps dropped 16C-20C (16 in most instances - PUBG still always runs high for some odd reason). I took pics of the TIM application and it seemed lacking..the pressure on the GPU from the original mount seemed fine..so it definitely seems to be a quality control issue from the factory. I got mine a few days after it launched..so I don't know if they were rushing it to get some stock on the market or what.  In the end, I'm really happy with it now with the new thermal paste. It could have been avoided, so I hope Sapphire reads this. Most buyers wouldn't tear it down like I did..so save yourself, the customer and Newegg a lot of grief by paying attention to this very important detail.  I'm very happy with the quality of the silicon I got, the clocks are amazing - and the build quality is great...just make sure the TIM is good Sapphire!!  Navi's temps are definitely higher than my Vega 56. This was surprising given the 7nm move. But with clocks generally 400Mhz above Vega 56... that's not really something to complain about.  Definitely buy it..just wanted the temp issue I had noted..so if you customers see the same, you know what to do, don't bother RMA'ing it over something like that...just make sure you have really small screw drivers!",2019-09-05 22:53:00

So in a couple more months when AMD has let their drivers mature on RDNA it is possible the 5700xt will beat the 2070S.  I don't regret my purchase at all. Glad AMD finally made something worth buying.  As a side note, Linux support is very lacking with this card, but hopefully, this will be resolved in September 2019. It is possible that some games will perform better on Linux than windows with the 5700xt once the drivers get ironed out (where the 5700xt/linux will beat 2070S/windows). This is true because Google is investing a lot of money into Stadia, which is an AMD cloud service that uses AMD + Linux to run games.  ","Overall Review: If you are planning to buy a card in this performance range, and have the money, you won't regret this purchase.  Raytracing is a thing, but, the next-gen consoles with determine the direction that technology takes, not NVIDIA. The next-gen consoles use AMD graphics.  Raytracing on the 2060S or the 2070S just isn't good enough. The only games that are fully raytraced are simple games like quake and Minecraft. More complex games won't have full raytracing for 5 years probably. By that time AMD will have their own ray tracing solution fully developed and you can replace the 5700 xt with whatever is out then. That's my plan anyway.",2019-08-27 02:42:00

GPU sets at about 55C at idle and about 80-85 C under load, and the Vram sets at 65C at idle and goes up to 90C under load. It's within safe temps according to AMD, but still higher than I'd like.  - Idle wattage is about 32, which is a bit higher than the 20W idle I was getting with the RX480, but that's probably only a few dollars a year so not a huge deal.  Edit: I adjusted the fan positions inside the case and shaved a couple of degrees off of the idle temps, enough to get the GPU fans to safely turn completely off and still keep the GPU at 53-54C I've also seen the load temps improve, the max VRM temps haven't gone above 85 since my first review so it seems like the 90C reading I got was an anomaly.  ","Overall Review: After gaming on this a few hours I checked the temps, but realized afterwards that the fan curve is EXTREMELY conservative. Maxing out at about 55%, so I adjusted the curve to hit about 80% at peak. I'll retest and update with new results if the temps are noticeably better.  This replaced an RX480 that I'd had for about 3 years, and it's an impressive upgrade.",2019-08-21 09:31:00

LED lights and nice backplate build quality looks solid cooling: fans and cooling are very good and quiet dual bios: LED light switch:  ,"Cons: price: this is the most expensive one. a little pricey, but worth it  ","Overall Review: ""This review for ASRock review rebate program.""  Even without the rebate, I would be recommending this. The card is Excellent. It is probably the top rx 5700xt and many of those “PRO” reviews out there belittling this card are nonsense. I have other top end RX 5700 XT's and compared myself.  A.) packaging of this card is what all GPU’s used to be packaged like. > You get dust protector caps, PCI protector, large antistatic bag, foam cushioning/mold (tight fit, no vibration) But No Display connectors/converters though (no one includes those anymore ! )  B.) testing at Defaults for the card which are: 1.) It is set on the OC BIOS (yes, they labelled the position of the switch! 2.) LED lights are on 3.) Asrock’s fan curve are slightly less aggressive, as the card runs fairly quiet. The fan’s will not spin at all until the card starts getting load and heats up > 2 side fans will spin, then the middle LED fan only as needed. 4.) 73-74c GPU temp / 93-94c MAX junction, (this is with default fan curve which favors sound instead of temp)  C.) Performance This is the fastest rx5700xt right now , with the highest clocks and will of course take more juice and create more heat. The cooling solution is excellent with a default fan curve that favors sound instead of temps. Temp reaches 73-74c GPU temp / junction temp 93-94c Max Adjusting the fan curve in wattman gives good results, With a slight undervolt, and fan curve adjust, memory OC, and slight power limit, Now I stay 65c for GPU and 72c junction at GClock 2000 or slightly under.  Some benches with adjustment. My scores may be low as older processor and not optimized system. Unigine Heaven 4 FHD: 204.1 FPS / 5142 score Unigine Valley 1 FHD: 108.4 FPS / 4535 Furmark 1.20.8 FHD: 140 FPS / 8413 points max temp 91c junction (at Default with no mod)  *Update: That backplate is as practical as it is pretty. It serves as a heat sink and gets HOT!, while GPU and junction stay in 70's and 92c respectively (default fan) or 65c GPU and 74c Junction with adjusted fan curve.",2019-11-08 18:26:00

I tried multiple drivers. I was only trying to play Guild Wars 2.  My second card. Runs HOT! Reviews of other 5700 XT cards said it would, but I had hoped for better temps with this heat sink and fan setup. AMD Drivers and Adrenalin software a mess. 19.9.1 stuttering with Guild Wars 2 and random black screens anytime, 19.9.2(WHQL) stuttering (FPS down to 2-3) with Guild Wars 2, 19.9.3 stuttering (FPS down to 2-3) with Guild Wars 2 and random black screens anytime, 19.10.1 wouldn't let me open Guild Wars 2, doing a search I found that earlier drivers did the same thing.  Had to manually uninstall drivers, as Adrenalin wasn't doing it all the time.  Even lowering the graphics setting in Guild War 2, from what I had them at for my 1080, isn't making a difference. So basically I downgraded from a 3 year old card.  ","Overall Review: I'm glad I'm not epileptic as I probably would have had a seizure by now with the stuttering in Guild Wars 2. I can't say how this card will work for other games, as this is the only one I'm playing at the moment and I'm not going to waste more of my time or money downloading or pay for a sub. While this card works fine for browsing, it's actually makes me nauseous trying to play Guild Wars 2.  There are multiple unanswered posts on the AMD forums about the 5700 XT card and drivers not playing nice with older games. I have had to reinstall my GTX 1080, as this card is not acceptable. So unless AMD comes out with a driver that works, I have an expensive paper weight.",2019-10-14 05:41:00

I figured I would go ahead and change the fan curve more aggressively to control temps and the fans were very loud! So now I have it on a very conservative fan curve with stock clocks and max temps reaches up to 105°C (No joke).  I did have a somewhat weird solution that fixes the loud fans and makes temps a bit more reasonable, but still hot. I ran stock fan curve of ""Silent"" Bios and undervolted the GPU from stock 1.2V to 1.05V and set clocks to 2000Mhz and the temps are now maxing out at 80°C under load while keeping the fans quite.

I switched from a RTX 2060 and that is scoring higher then what I can currently achieve with this in benchmarks. Not sure if it's an issue with AMD drivers or something defective with my card. I did reinstall Windows and same results. For a quick comparison I got 56 fps with a RTX 2060 in 1440p ultra settings in Total War: Warhammer 2, with this RX 5700 XT I'm getting a 39 fps average same settings. So the card works and you can game on it, just it's a gimped performance compared to what the RX 5700 XT is supposed to achieve.

Had to pay $20 to ship it back to Newegg, which negated any ""deal"" I had previously gotten on this card. As for the performance: so far so good. The card is sturdy, doesn't run too loud or too hot under load, and does what it is advertised to do for all intents and purposes. However, given the current state of the GPU market, I regret taking the gamble with this card. Had I waited a bit longer I would have bought a better card from a more reliable brand, and likely have been more satisfied with my purchase. At the current pricetag, the card is not worth the risk. I'm bumping my rating up by one egg since the card at least functions, for now.  As a side note, if you're going to be playing Path of Exile, go with an NVIDIA card instead. PoE has historically had compatibility issues with AMD cards. Years ago I played the game on a 7770 HD and there were massive display issues. While the issues are far less understated today while using this card, there are still indeed noticeable display issues after upgrading from my GTX 760.",2018-05-28 22:24:00

After a month of being told that the problem was that my mobo didnt have integrated graphics (what?) and having to uninstall/reinstall windows 10 at the request of the tech support guy (with no success) I decided to RMA the card.  I was really excited when I got the RMAed card back and popped it into my system, It had been two months since I sent the card to them and I was finally ready to play doom without constant stuttering. Nope! its just as broken as the day I first slotted it in. When I contacted powercolor RMA they told me that the card worked perfectly when it went into their system and I shouldn't have a problem with it. I had spent four months total doing any sort of trouble shooting at this point: Putting it in a friends system (also didnt work), entirely cleaning any and all nvidia drives with programs like driver fusion, and trying all four of my PCIe slots. At this point I was tired of doing this and decided to call new egg. They told me I could exchange this card for another comparable RX580 from another company ASSUMING I still had the original box (never throw that away). I decided to do that and my Asus RX580 was there later that week, I slotted it in and booted up my PC, and it worked perfectly.  So at this point I'm wondering if I can use this card instead of returning it after all, I realized that I could try to get crossfire working before the deadline to send back this card was up. I'm sure this will shock you, but this card is just as broken for crossfire as it was for a single card setup. Windows actually detects the card in device manager and ASUS GPU Tweak II (the only evidence I have other than the fans that the card works) but gives me an error. In device manager, my ASUS 580 is working perfectly, but the Powercolor card says ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"". This appears to completely negate its ability to process any sort of graphics. Being the clever mind I am, I called powercolor and asked them why the card wouldn't be working with all the drivers sorted out and a fresh version of windows 10, and he asked me if i had another system to test the card in (a third separate computer that is). I told him I didn't own more than one computer and asked him if I was missing something or if the card really was unusable, or if I was missing something. He told me that ""Its not unusable, it should be working just fine, try uninstalling and reinstalling windows again to see if that solves the problem.  I would say that the good news about this card is that is just cost me a huge amount of time, not money, but I checked the RMA conditions and apparently theres a 15% restocking fee. Dont skimp on good retailers like i did, and make sure to never buy anything from PowerColor unless you want to spend half a year aimlessly trying to figure out whats wrong with your card.  Heres my specs in case theres something about these parts that's the problem, but thats unliely given how easilt the ASUS card worked:  GPU - This card, Asus Dual Radeon RX580 8GB GDDR5 CPU - AMD Ryzen 3 1300X RAM - CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 Mobo - Asus Prime B350-Plus PSU - Corsair cx650 Storage - Seagate 1TB baracuda SATA 5400 rpm 6Gb/",s,2018-05-24 16:42:00

I mostly play overwatch and a few other competitive games and this allows me to run them at 1440p, over 100 (usually 120-130) fps with most settings maxed if I turn down a few things like light effects and such. With freesync, which is amazing, it feels like im mxing my 144hz monitor at all times. buttery smooth, no screen tearing, etc. This is my first experience with freesync and high rex and high fps gaming, and I am absolutely impressed  ","Cons: EDIT: I have amended my review, as it turns out that the black screen issue I was having was one with my monitor, not my GPU.  My only complaint is how loud this card gets under heavy load.  Oh, and do be warned that there are no drivers for Windows 8.1. I was not able to find any work around for this, and ultimately was forced to upgrade to windows 10 just to use this card.  ","Overall Review: Overall, I love this card. I'd give it a 4.5 for the sound, but that rounds up.  In the end, if you're playing optimized ""e sports"" style games, this will push at or near 144hz even at 1440p with maxed settings. And it can easily get at least 60 fps on more ""AAA"" titles with the same max or near max settings at 1440p. Throw in freesync (which I'd assume would be why you'd buy this card over a 1060 6gb for a similar price) and its a wonderful gaming experience.",2017-12-23 04:50:00

That card was in a similar 'class' as this card, but because of the mining that gained popularity just after I bought the card prices haven't come down since then. That card died beause I neglected to clean the dust from inside the heatsink on the card, so it was overheating and eventually the GPU assembly probably lost contact with the motherboard. Louis Rossman demonstrated that you cannot simply stick your card in an oven, you need expensive soldering equipment, so I ended up replacing that card, with something that was now over twice the price.

Dragon Center can be a a bit of a pain at times, but a good uninstall and reinstall does justice.  REMEMBER, uninstall ALL previous GC drivers before installing this one. There are two 5700 xt versions. I downloaded the regular drivers instead of the 50th anniversary one. So the well known screen flickering was present because of bad drivers. I uninstalled these drivers and installed the correct, 50th anniversary drivers, and I had no problem. When first playing a game be a bit patient. How I see it, it ""configures"" itself for a first time set up for the game. I can play Tomb Raider at 4k with about 45 fps everything maxed out. I can also play Hunt: Showdown at 4k with about 30-45 fps with everything maxed out. For hunt, I may need to do some optimization. To me, 4k doesn't matter to much because my monitor is meant for it. At regular 1080p, I usually get above 60 fps. There is also an overclocking method with the GC so play safely!  Also make sure you keep the drivers up to date or it wont work.  MSI's version of this card works because of good engineering. I would stick with MSI given the option for this GC. Happy gaming!",2020-03-09 13:47:00

Especially the manual (Which was honestly probably my favorite thing. The artwork in the manual is top-notch and I loved the little dragon). It's a very nice looking, and beefy card. I like both of those things!  With that said, I had nothing but problems since the first day with this card (I did wind up returning it and just getting a 2080ti instead). I was unable to run 3 1400 144hz displays. I'm not sure if this was a problem with the card, or maybe just AMD drivers.  I couldn't play any games with this. Games would CONSTANTLY have issues. For instance, starting Dota 2. The game couldn't figure out what display to put the window on. I tried different settings. Forcing windowed, or full screen. Dota 2 would CONSTANTLY (I mean every second or two) minimize, full screen, minimize. The screen would go black. I'd see Dota 2 for a second. Then minimize, full screen, minimize etc. It was a constant loop that would go on for about a minute or two before the system/Dota gave up.  You get the picture. It was a nightmare. It wasn't just Dota 2. I had issues with tons of other games. Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, CoD WW2.  I don't play at 4k. I don't even play at 1440. I play at 1080, vsync off and generally try to just get the best performance possible. I generally don't care how a game looks. I'm a pretty competitive gamer (SMFC/GE in CS GO, Diamond+ in Overwatch and other games, I used to raid lead 2 heroic progression guilds and had world rankings back in the day - Heroic as in pre mop) and so I wasn't pushing the card that hard. I never even TRIED to play anything at 4k. Probably the hardest thing I did was leaving heaven running for a few hours to stress the gpu when I first got it. Maybe that killed the card?  The card kept overheating, like a lot. The system would constantly hard lock. Like if you did some massive overclock and the driver couldn't recover. I would have to power cycle the machine. This happened ALL the time. It got to the point where the machine couldn't even stay on for 10-15 minutes at a time even just watching youtube videos (Seriously). I literally wasn't able to browse the web for long enough when trying to look for other people having the same problem.  I didn't do any crazy overclocking. The only thing I did in Afterburner was crank the fan speeds to 100% (I don't care about noise) and I added about 100mhz core clock and memory. I didn't touch core voltage whatsoever.  Maybe it's just bad airflow? I thought about this. I have a Define R6, I pulled off the glass panel and stuck a giant fan right into the machine full blast. I still had the same issue eventually. Maybe there was an issue with a thermal pad in the card, maybe it was just flat out missing some, I don't know. I didn't take it apart. All I know is it just had constant problems.  I tried uninstalling the most recent driver, I installed older drivers. Same thing. I even did a clean install of windows (Ya, formatted it and everything!). I then tried playing games without any drivers installed (Big shock, didn't help). Then installing the newest (Recommended, not optional) I still had the same problems on a CLEAN INSTALL of windows 10 1903.  I then went down to 2 displays. Maybe 3 is just too much? But nope. Same problems.  I gave up dealing with AMDs drivers, and all the constant problems. I just had to return it after several days of frustration.  Also, it's worth noting that when I would remove the card and put in anything else, I had no issues whatsoever. So... It's possible I just had a bad card; it happens. But this kinda stuff makes me not want to get an AMD gpu. I like their cpu's but their gpu's have nothing but problems and maybe it's just me but... It's just not worth the frustration.  I just gave up, I didn't want to deal with AMD anymore and just wanted to go back to NVIDIA. Sorry. :(  I still like the dragon though.",2019-10-18 09:32:00

On initial setup I could not get screen flickering to subside at 144hz. I tried all available drivers from AMD, CRU (custom monitor software to override settings), and even swapped out multiple monitors and display port cords to be certain (to no avail). What finally did the trick was uninstalling Dragon Center (MSI's GPU utility application) and underclocking and undervolting the card slightly. The card is now stable and running like a champ but it was not a fun process to get here.  The card itself is nice and comparable to the Nitro + and Red Devil variants by other vendors. I ultimately went with this variant because of the lower temps and ambient noise as reported by Hardware Unboxed. Be aware that it is recommended you use a 750 watt PSU instead of a 650 watt like other variants of the card. I don't care for the RGB lighting but if that's your thing it's definitely an added bonus.  So far I've only tested Sekiro (FPS unlocked) and the new Assasin's Creed but both games run perfect at 2K with everything maxed out. Have not had any game or OS crashes.

Glad to see it come down in price. Handles rending large and complex 3D scenes. I use this card for 3D modeling and some light gaming. The two games that I play, ark survival evolved, and ghost recon wildlands. Frame rate With Everything set to max and checked marked in Full HD runs around 65-35 FPS. This card is designed for PCI Express 3.0 and I have it on PCI Express 2.0 Losing about 10 to 15% performance. However, it still does a great job for what I use it for. Runs cool and never had it to overheat. READ The Overall Review to know why. Fans on the card do a pretty good job cooling, and they are not too loud. I only just start to hear them around 2500 RPM, not a bad experience. I can't stress this enough you need to have a computer case that will move all of that heat out! With that said everything is running smoothly.  ","Cons: The GIGABYTE Radeon RX Vega 64 really should be a five-star card, but the manufacturer will send you out-dated drivers, and a version of the aorus software that is buggy for me. My card crashed and locked me out of my computer. Lucky, there was a restore point created a day before the installation. A lot of time was wasted trying to recover and uninstall drivers. Once, I was back into my OS I went on to GIGABYTE'S website and downloaded the latest driver. It Still crashed on me one time after the installation was complete, but thankfully once the computer had restarted everything was fine.  I'm not going to compline about power consumption or how hot this card is. After reading the specs and other people's reviews on this card it's not a surprise that it gets very hot and is higher on the wattage.  You need to have a great fan case, with all of your cooling fans unblocked for maximum airflow. Before I undervolted this card it ran at 32- 42 C* at idle and 60 to 68 C* (on the spot) when under heavy loads. Once undervolted, temps went down to 28C* on idle, 50 to 56C* under max loads. So heat control is not a problem for me, but If you can get a liquid cooler, do it!  Wattman IS TRASH! or at least I don't like it. Get MSI afterburner or something else for tuning your card.  ","Overall Review: Radeon RX vega 64 graphics card is for the enthusiast benchmarkers and gamers who build customs rigs. Once this card is set up you need to undervolt, finetune the core clock, and Memory bus speeds; in order to manage the wattage and heat coming off this card.  My PSU is 750 watt. and I know I should have this card on an 850, but I have no problems running it for what I have.

Initially the card didn't meet my expectations until I applied an undervolt/overclock and raising power limit with a higher fan speed. +2% GPU oc, p6 1000 mV p7 1050mV HMB2 1050 mhz 990 mV and power limit to 40%. Now we're cooking with fire! Runs Far Cry 5 at 4k with mixed high to ultra setting 55-60 fps easily and 100 fps on 1440p ultra. Temps are usually around 70 C gaming at 2400 rpm, could honestly go with a lower speed for noise reduction and still be ok. Alphacool makes a waterblock for this card if someone goes the liquid cooling route  Be forewarned this card does use more power but it's really a very small drop in the bucket. The card also require a case with good airflow to keep temps down (if you're gaming you should have a high airflow case no matter the card). Wattman isn't the greatest tool as it would never allow the card to go above 70 C even with higher fan curve after UV/OC or I'd get thermal throttling down to 1460 mHz from 1630+. Leaving the card in stock form temps would regularly get up to 75 C and no throttling. Weird. MSI Afterburner fixed my issues with tuning the card. If you like pretty lights this card will disappoint you. There is no RGB or LED whatsoever, just a big black chunk of plastic with orange stripes. I'd recommend this card only if you have the right case, power supply (850W) and don't mind tuning the card yourself.

","Cons: -The card is a little boring to look at. (Not that I care.) -Not faster than a 1080ti. -People have reported issues with cooling I have not experienced, but some could have this issue. -Under stock settings, a Vega card is not that great. I tried several tests before the undervolting, and I never saw above 1467MHZ with this card, and even then it dropped below that often. (Again, temps never went above 60c.)  ","Overall Review: The card would crash under stock settings, after about 3 hours under full load, but the temps looked great all the time. After the undervolting I haven’t had an issue, but no two cards are the same. HBM2 is stacked, so the temps can be hard to tell, but whatever stack is reporting seems to be fine with my card.

I uninstalled my old drivers for my Radeon RX 480 card, closed out of windows, and then it was time to open my case. Out came the RX 480 and in went my new GIGABYTE RX Vega 64. I closed the case and booted into windows. It was then time to install the new Adrenalin 2019 drivers. This, too, went without a hitch.  Now, it was time to play some games. I had some concern as the wattage this card would draw as I only had a Corsair HX750 750 watt power supply. I loaded up a heavily modded version of Skyrim: Special Edition. The wattage draw was around 200 watts to 250 watts. The temperature of the card hovered around 75° degrees. Kind of on the warm side. Skyrim looked beautiful, though, at 4K on my Asus MG28UQ 4K monitor. My frame rates varied between 30 and 40 fps. Freesync was enabled and kept things smooth as butter.  I give this card a thumbs up for giving me playable framerates at 4K resolutions. The install was easy as pie as well. It is also hundreds of dollars less than a GTX 1080 and competes with this card frame rate wise at most resolutions. You get a lot of bang for your buck at $499.  ","Cons: My only issue with this card is heat. At 75° degrees normal operating temperature, you can fry an egg on the back plate. If you touch it, you can burn your fingers. I do not know if this is normal or not.  ",Overall Review: There is something magical about being a gamer and getting a new piece of hardware like this.

Regardless of online reviews and store opinions this is a direct upgrade from the 580 Polaris cards. The card is well constructed and is actually the smallest AIB Vega 64 card that you can buy. Vega is a card for people who like to tune their components. Undervolting actually has a discernable difference in performance. In terms of performance i definitely see how Vega is a viable card even at inflated prices. I think it is because I had a 7950 crossfire setup that I believe in AMD. I seriously do not think that I will need an upgrade in Graphics processing for at least 3 years. I am a Total War nut so this will cover me for Sagas of Brittania and the two I am salivating for, Total War 3 Kingdoms and TWWH 3. If you have a Freesync monitor this is a great option.  ",Cons: The cost of the GPU is definitely prohibitive. The cooling on the card is substandard I do not believe the HBM is being cooled correctly as I was getting random shutdowns in heavy gaming sessions. AMD overlay would show 78 C before I would see a shutdown. Having said that this is in a crossfire setup and acts as the 2nd card. The issue has since been resolved  ,Overall Review: At the price it is definitely not a price for the casual gamer. However if you had a Tahiti GPU and did not feel the satisfaction of the almost horizontal upgrade from the Tahiti to Polaris. Other than power draw Tathiti in some ways is just as good as Polaris. Vega is definitely an upgrade over Polaris and it kills every game I throw at it.  2018-06-12 Update: I became so frustrated with the shutdowns that I decided to do something that I never do with brand new GPUs. I removed the shroud to expose the GPU and what did I see? Almost no thermal paste. I RECCOMOND TO ANYONE WHO OWNS ANY VEGA AIB CARD to check the paste applied to their cards as the HBM and GPU are on the same die. Once I applied some Noctua Thermal paste to the chip I no longer get temps past 66 degrees. The other thing is I get a consistent 1645 MHZ clock on the GPU and the Memory never goes under 945 MHZ.,2018-07-13 06:09:00

Excellent graphics at 4K.  ,"Cons: Like everyone else, I dislike the price; however, a person shouldn't give it a low Star/Egg rating on these issue as the card itself is excellent. It's not the cards fault that prices on AMD cards are so high, nor is it the brand/manufacturers that are at fault. Might as well blame the economy, NewEgg, or that it's raining on the day you want to purchase. If there is something wrong with the card, either in manufacture or design then I could see a reason for so many negatives along with the low Star rating; but, this isn't the case.

I have maybe a quarter inch of clearance before it touches the PSU grill that has holes but not a lot for air and it still stays very cool and near silent.  - AMD cards have heat issues, this generation especially. So imagine my surprise that I never hear this card's fans ramp up. EVER. I've never had a card that I couldn't at least hear ramp up ever so slightly over long gaming sessions. Sapphire did an awesome job with this cooler. Dare I say, it's witchcraft given that this is the highest factory clocked card, too.  -I think the 5600XT is the perfect price/performance/heat balance. It's nearly as good as a 5700 and a 5700XT simply is not worth the price premium. Let alone above it. It seems 5700 and on cards tend to get toastier so if you need a solid mini ITX card that can handle 2 and 1/4 slots, this is perfect.  - I get solid 70-100 average FPS at 1440p. People say this is a 1080p card and maybe once next generation consoles kick things off it will be. But if you're looking to play today's games and yesterday's, you can't beat this price to performance ration. If you're satisfied with 60 FPS, this card delivers easily at 1440p for most games at max settings. Should be good for 120+ FPS at 1080p too.  ","Cons: - AMD Drivers. Yes, they're still awful. Yes they still give mixed results. Yes, you have to deal with this fact. To be fair they control panel is less insufferable now and I have had less issues (none in gaming so far) but issues I still have.  - AMD Freesync works pretty poorly on this card for some reason. I assume it's drivers since my monitor is freesync and approved for gsync use and works great there. An old RX480 also works fine in every freesync mode as well. This card, for whatever AMD silly reason, will do it but it will give issues -like black screening when alt-tabbing or not working at all (black screen) when in ultimate engine mode. No doubt, this is a driver issue fighting my configuration somehow and not the card itself, but I promise you AMD WILL welcome you to the party, pal with some driver issue. For me, I am always lucky it's something different every time I go back to them. At least this time it isn't game performance anomalies.  - 6GB memory. AMD had to do something to artificially differentiate this card. Still, even at 1440p it'll get you through most games at high res textures. Easily at 1080 resolution.  ","Overall Review: AMD has always been a mixed bag (I miss ATI...) but I needed a card that would perform well in a mini-ITX case without sounding like a jet engine. This card performs a lot better than I expected for AMD taxes (driver issues) and known heat for this series of cards. It had a rough launch but now things are smooth so I highly recommend it. Particularly when it goes on sale. Just hope you don't run into weird issues unique to AMD. But good news if you do, there'll be tons of reddit threads to help you!",2020-04-09 21:46:00

He has a 144hz 1080p freesync monitor and he was obviously not getting the best any more with his 980Ti. Because I upgraded his monitor a few months ago to a freesync I have been waiting for the 5600XT to hit the market as I have been so impressed with my 5700XT (which I have under water as stock cooler was LOUD). I also wanted a card that could be bios upgraded completely, both memory and core and the Pulse hit the mark. It is extremely quiet at idle and load and has been running like a champ at 1080p. I am impressed again with AMD. I can't really think of any negatives unless raytracing is something you want from a video card, and if this is the case then you won't find a great solution at this price range as raytracing will really have a huge hit on FPS. Overclocking was not good on this card, so I left it where it was and to be honest after looking at reviews for the stock 5700 this 5600XT after bios upgrade was running almost as fast.  The card is quiet, runs cool, handles anything at high fps in 1080p, was easy to update with the faster bios' and take a single 8pin pci-e cable. Added to a system with a freesync monitor and you will have gaming nirvana (IMO of course).",2020-03-23 04:10:00

I can now play pretty much everything in the Rift-S Library without issue.  Otherwise, it's been amazing for typical desktop gaming; I've been playing pretty much every game I had before on the 1060, but maxed out HIGH/Ultra-High settings and all options enabled, usually with FPS to spare (1080p, 1440p) -- it does struggle to get above the 40 fps mark in 4K gaming though, not sure if that is normal since I haven't done much but it fits the bill for my normal 'gaming setup' so I'm not going to complain.

If you're looking at cost for performance this is it. Went from a 1070 TI to this thing and it's no contest, this card is miles better when running a 1440 gaming setup.  ",Cons: -- Runs a bit hot under a full load. -- Currently experiencing a fan RPM whine straight out of the box. Pretty disappointing to say the least because it's very loud and starts about 5 minutes into playing any game and will not stop until it goes back to idle speeds.  Due to the fan whine I have to give this 3 out of 5 eggs. Depending on how responsive/easy customer service is that score may go up or down. I'll come back and adjust once I know more.  ,"Overall Review: I've gone through the Gigabyte website to submit a ticket to see what they say. It might be an RMA and if so - that sucks. It's bad enough to send off a graphics card for what often takes a lengthy time to get a replacement. But doing an RMA while business are closed and tech support centers are flooded is a double whammy.  In fairness, I bought this because I had to send my MSI 1070 TI due to it failing. The MSI card is sitting in RMA for an estimate 17 - 35 business days. Oh the irony of buying a new graphics card to take place of another graphics card under RMA only to RMA this one...  Update 4/26/20: Gigabyte asked me to request a replacement through Newegg so I'm going through the process now. I'm sure Newegg will not disappoint but i'm docking another egg from this card due to poor quality control. At least my previous MSI lasted 14 months before giving me issues.",2020-04-26 07:37:00

I assumed it was a FA0 bios problem as it would run the card at a higher speed but even the ""stable"" FA2 gave me problems.  Got many Black, Blue, and even a couple Green screens. Lots of crashing, very unstable. Couldn't play a game more than 2 hours. Many benchmark programs even crashed.  The computer would sometimes crash and exit the game/program but more often than not the whole computer would need a full reboot (blue screen). On occasion the computer couldn't even respond and needed a force-shutdown.  I spent hours researching and troubleshooting only to find that many other people using this card have the same or similar issues. Very unfortunate as some other manufacturers of this same card have none of these issues. This is not a Gigabyte problem, but just a 5600xt (and 5700xt) problem from the research I did online.  It's too bad that this card had a lot of potential but I opted to return RMA and used that money toward an RTC 2060. At the time of this post many RTx 2060s are on sale right now so you could probably find one for not much more than this card. Paying a little extra from the start and saving all the time I spent troubleshooting would have been nice in the end.  ",Overall Review: tl;dr do not buy this without doing some research on whether there has been an update to make the card more stable. It would be a great purchase at this price if the card could actually run without crashing. My recommendation: purchase a discounted RTX 2060 as there are quite a few clearance sales to make way for the next gen RTX 3000 series.

It looks awesome, but it crashes, and crashes, and crashes... -FA0 bios is absolute trash, crashes after every 7-15 minutes, F2 is a little better, but still a nightmare, ended up installing factory bios F60.

It barely seats properly cause it hits my motherboard(MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX). But it still works, just mentioning it so people with the B450 know to expect that.  Sometimes when I run Apex legends it takes up 5.5/6 GB of the VRAM. This is inconstant and could be an issue with drivers or Apex, just thought it was worth mentioning in case someone else runs into this issue.

I tried to adjust settings and smooth things out, but it would still dip super low for no reason. Then I started getting Green and White screens during games, and super sluggy response when it would work. All of this in under a week!  Im sorry AMD, I wanted to love you guys.

The card runs quiet and cool, although you might need to do a little tweaking to the fan curve to get it just where you need it.  Runs all of the games that I play very well, with no stuttering, hitching or otherwise. Minimal sacrifice needed to achieve 144 FPS on titles @ 1440p, should you desire a higher framerate over higher fidelity.  The card also has a very pleasing look, and tastefully done RGB. Excellent accent lights, as well as fan-lights, give me the oppertunity to sync the card to the rest of the systems RGB.  ","Cons: Drivers. I haven't taken any eggs off for this for the simple fact that it was mostly my own fault.  Experience will vary widely, but switching to the WHQL driver fixed the myriad of issues I was having with this card. At the time of writing, that version is 19.12.2.  Some issues still exist, such as scrolling through gifs on Discord will cause some of them to turn green, but that's a fairly small nonissue in my opinion.  ","Overall Review: In the end, I would absolutely recommend this card. Driver issues aside, this is a very well done card.  One thing I would wish for though is a manual percentile control of fans, much like on EVGA's Precision X. Fan curves are very nice, but sometimes it's nice to just set a % that you know is quiet and cools well and leave it until you're done. Perhaps in a future iteration of Sapphires' TRIXX?",2020-01-14 01:55:00

Runs Division 2 at 60 fps. Still adjusting the settings in game to optimize.  ,Cons: Card is flimsy. Heavy Heatsync/fan. This card would benefit so much from a backpate.  ,"Overall Review: My experience so far with the card has been good. It was two other instances that soured my overall experience. These have nothing to do with the MSI Card and it's performance at all.  Firstly. When they say that you get the games for free as a gift, you have to know that you will still pay for the game. Your Card gets the 129$ discount to offset the Gift. I thought it was strange to do it this way and maybe they have to do it this way but it seemed a little underhanded that the site says you get a free gift and you end up “paying” for the games and get a heavily discounted video card.  Secondly. AMD Rewards dot com sucks. My first issue is that I bought the card and when it was shipped I received my “gift” voucher for the games. Fine. I got my voucher. I’ll go download the games and play them a bit while I am waiting for the video card to arrive. NOPE. You have to have the video game installed to Validate the game. They will not give you the game until there is a 570 or 580 video card in your computer. I found this frustrating because since I technically “Paid” for these games, I should have access to them immediately. I had to wait until I got the card before I could even register the games. Extremely offputting.  Thirdly. I created an account on AMD Rewards dot com and something strange happened. About 3 hours after I created the account my Ubisoft account started sending me messages saying here is your access code. I received 34 messages from Ubisoft to log in. I thought this had something to do with my new AMDREWARDS account so I logged into it and put in a ticket with the site. They said I had to wait 5-6 days for any help. I decided that I would have to disable the account. After disabling the account the messages didn’t stop. I went into my Uplay account and made some changes to my account. I then had about a day of silence. I thought it was over. I then started receiving the emails again. I received a lot of messages. I made some more security changes and I haven’t had any issues since. Needless to say this is the first time I have EVER had an issue with any kind of Software Distribution Software and the issue popped up right after I created an AMD Rewards account. I run virus/malware scans on my computer often and have never had an issue. I think this is too much of a coincidence to not mention it.",2019-03-27 11:21:00

Now, I'm not running the above games on Ultra. I have made tweaks to my game setting. But for the most part, the setting are on High or Medium setting. And the games look good! I even made minor changes to my regedit keys. And I have this GPU overclocked, but that's in minuscule amount.  I am running this on 1440p ladies n gents. Needles to say this card has NO Problems Ultra 1080p (I did play on 1080p before I ungraded to 1440p). This card has served me very well. I was even considering trying to cross fire, but with all the new GPU about to come out, I will upgrade this eventually to hit that 144mhz mark.  ","Cons: Can sometimes cause a few issue on 1440p, it might crash but that's rarely. BUT I want to blame that on old drivers... Again had no problems on 1080p. I don't know what the issue is with HDR, but the colors seem a bit 'washed out'. Of course, I can always turn off HDR and the colors look great. YOU the buyer, should also consider weather or not you will be using an HDR monitor. Most of you , don't even have an HDR monitor (plz remember 'game mode' on most monitors are NOT the same as HDR) So if you're using a regular monitor, you may ignore my point on HDR",.,2019-01-23 06:44:00

If your card is hitting around 75C and higher, it needs cool air. If not more case fans, the right orientation should do it (pull fresh air up into the GPU in most PC cases). - Using Overwatch, I've seen the GPU as cool as 35C when starting the game, GPU fans kick on around 54-55C, and hovers around 65-70C when in combat.",2019-01-16 23:27:00

Called MSI the first guy I spoke with was cool and said that was too hot and that they would replace it. Said he needed to email a manager. A week went buy no email. Called and they said they did not have a replacement and suggested I go through the RMA process. I did, here's what happened next.... That agent said ""Dear Rodney that Is normal temp especially if under load. if you still wish to send it in for rma service use the link below"" HUH? You're kidding me? One guy says that's not normal and too hot, next guy said it's fine. Make up your mind MSI. I installed an after market air cooler from Arctic. WOW!!! What a difference. Idles under 40c and under load 72c and quiet as a mouse. So why cant MSI install a decent cooling solution for their card. I have lots of MSI cards none of them run that hot. All NVIDA cards by the way. So AMD cards run hot...They need better cooling I say. Not happy with MSI I had to potentially void my warranty to get a good working card.

Stays 60c and below with fans on auto which is super quiet Came with Samsung memory Other than my failed attempts at overclocking, card seems to run fine 120 FPS in most games maxed out in 1440p  ","Cons: I spent all day trying to overclock this, I mean this is why we bought this card right? Well I don't understand how most are hitting 2100 Mhz and above with those +130 core clocks... I was able to push the memory +1000 and +110 core but the second I went higher and hit 2100Mhz I crash. I actually just crashed out of Metro Exodus with the +1000/+110, so I set it back to default speeds.  It also won't let me adjust the power limit slider, says I'm already hitting the power limit at 305 volts and when I slide it to the right, it just resets itself. My voltage also won't increase at all no matter how much I move the slider. I was using Heaven for 30 mins before I tested games with the OC. First time overclocking but no matter how many videos/forums I look up, this card doesn't seem like it wants to overclock much at all. Yeah the stock speed is quite faster than advertised and I got Samsung memory but I was expecting to be able to ""easily overclock"" this card like everyone claims. Why else would I spend $1600 on a GPU...  I'll continue to try things out but so far the overclocking has been a fail.   UPDATE: Ok so I have spent days researching what others have been overclocking this card to and have been trying different things. Basically, you have to run PX1 in administrator mode in order to change the power slider. With that being said I was still only able to get a stable +100 core/ +1000 memory overclock which puts me at 2070 MHz in game and 8000 memory. So far after hours gaming in Metro Exodus, BF5, Squad and Insurgency Sandstorm. I'm getting a solid 120 fps in 1440p with settings maxed, the occasional dip but 100 fps min. Not Metro with ray tracing set to high and tessellation turned off. That game is seriously taxing even with the fastest gpu and cpu (9900k)... 70-90 fps on that one, maybe hitting 100 in some scenes.  To be honest I expected to be able to overclock this card higher. At least 2130 MHz instead of 2070 but after reading forum after forum, anything above 2100 is actually rather rare and the difference is very minor. Some can't get past 2055 so with my stable 2070, I am grateful. Temps are not the issue as this card does not go over 60c with the OC with fans on auto with the aggressive fan curve option. So from what I've read, Nvidia has really capped the power or maybe the voltage on these cards, something... I feel like there's more power hidden in there because it stays so cool but the second I up the core clock to anything over +100, I crash. Literally the second it hits 2100, everything freezes.  When I hear about people getting 2130-2170+ core clock with cards that are supposed to be less overclock friendly, the lesser tier cards from EVGA, that makes me second guess why I needed to buy the FTW3. To the people who got 2185ish .... Silicon Lottery right?  At the end of the day it destroys almost everything I throw at it and I get use of my monitors full refresh rate of 120. Hopefully ray tracing become more optimized in the future so we can really get our money's worth",.,2019-05-01 17:30:00

The nearly 3 slots it takes up makes it difficult to do two of them in SLI/NV link.  ","Overall Review: So, I recently upgraded my 1st gen Intel Core i7 980X to an i9-9900k, along with 32GB of DDR4-3200, a 1TB M.2, and an Asrock Tai Chi Ultimate Z390, and I kept my twin eVga FTW 1070's to see if they would shine a bit better with a super fast CPU. Well, they did, but I was fighting SLI scaling. The two 1070's put up big numbers running 3D Mark and such, but I couldn't even run the 1st Crysis game from 2007 at 60 fps at 4k with all sliders to the right! Not to mention, Ghost Recon Wildlands either. So, after doing some research, watching videos and reading reviews, I pulled the trigger. I did buy directly from the manufacturer, but I wish I got it from Newegg for the free games offer. I was very hesitant about buying one of these because all of the nightmare micron memory issues and RMAs, but I did anyway, in hopes that I would land a card with Samsung RAM. Thank goodness I did! Needless to say, what I learned, is that you're better off with a bulldozer than a pair of small bobcats! This single card obliterated a few of my 3D Mark records by a mile! Some other 3D Mark scores were just a TAD lower than my SLI'd GTX 1070's. All in all, I am crazy impressed by this card. I doubt that I will even OC it, because it already boosts itself to 2050 MHz! As far as temps go, it sits at around 32c idle and gaming is around 62c. The card went into my Cooler Master HAF 932 case effortlessly, but if nVidia makes these things much larger, it will be difficult to squeeze one into my case! Bottom line is: real world performance is what it's all about with a card like this. I could have probably gotten by with a ""standard"" 2080ti, but hey, why do that? I wanted the fastest GPU, paired with the fastest current CPU. Stability and speed is paramount for my build, and those come with a hefty price tag.

Got this card on sale 10% off plus 20 rebate made it 357 total. Bought it down to the normal price i think it should be for a 2060 card. YES there are EVGA cards out there you can get for around 300 single fan 3 slot cards and almost got that one but when this one went on sale wasn't going to pass it up. If u want the best 2060 card out there this is the one to get. Was going for the Gigabyte Pro OC6G 3 fan model but after this sale the gigabyte was the same price so no contest at that point. Rog Strix wins and it is a little better built card.  ,"Cons: PRICE. Yes, if this card is not on sale i wouldnt not buy it. If u have room for a 3 fan card and want a QUIET model, the gigabyte Pro OC 6G card would be the one to get instead of this one. Rog Strix is just too expensive to recommend at the current prices these other vendors are going for. Software seems to be a bit buggy as i installed the asus lighting software and gpu tweak and then removed it as the tweak when my computer would go to sleep it needs a reboot to wake up the monitor again. Have read issues with their software.  ",Overall Review: Still it is the top of the line 2060 card and it shows. Back-plate and the card is Heavy compared to the gigabyte. The heat-sink is bigger and wider so i dont think the fans have to work as hard. Though Gigabyte has its unique middle fan spinning the opposite direction to they say 'combat turbulence'. Not sure how much of a diff that actually makes. Any 2060 will clock about the same and performance wise speeds are all about even on any 2060 u get.,2019-08-02 14:33:00

Since my fans only start at 60, thats quite impressive especially overclocked, if the 3 fans ever kick in temps prolly will never reach anything above 60. Ill set profile to start at 55 degrees probably. -I got to 2020 mhz overclock stable, got a good boost at memory too. Even people who got less had a nice boost too. -DLSS will give nice fps gains if we ever get more games that supports it. -Had absolutly no problems, no crashes, artefacts, be sure to DDU if you upgrade from a GTX nonetheless.  ","Cons: -Will probably be a bit weak for raytracing, hard to say though, its new and probably badly optimized at the moment, and will probably depends on how developpers implements it. -Really big, many ATX boxes will have problems fitting it in. I had to pry some metal ;) -Quite heavy too  ","Overall Review: I really suggest you get this ROG STRIX over any other RTX 2060 models, the difference in temperatures and the well designed plate will definitly helps the card's lifespan, and the overclocks I got are quite awesome. Worth the few more bucks definitly. Well done ! If you know nothing about overclocking, OC scanner included in GPU Tweak II , or OC scanner in that other particular software(dont know if im allowed to suggest a software since its not included) will give you the boost you need , got up to 1975mhz. Perfect for 1080p. On a sidenote, it overkills Resident Evil 2 Remaster at 4kmax , gpu almost stays idle got temps around 35-40 no bottlenecks on whole system. On a Ryzen 5 2600 oc to 4.1 .

I previously had the XC version and when the fans started up or would ramp down they made a clicking grinding noise briefly, so I called EVGA and they cross shipped me a card and low and behold the replacement card still had that same issue and the card also didn't overclock as well as the original card and ran 5 degrees hotter. I actually kept the original card and decided to live with the clicking. Point being I upgraded to the XC Ultra and the same clicking noise is present. Not the end of the world just annoying for a $1250 card to experience this and really all of our expectations at this price point is what defines the RTX lineup. For $1250 people not only expect perfection but also a card that murders the previous gen GTX 1080 Ti and while the RTX 2080 Ti is the fastest consumer gaming graphics card, it's only about 20% faster on average compared to a GTX 1080 Ti unless you do 4K gaming and then the RTX 2080 Ti really shines since it is the only card that can do 4K gaming at at least 60 FPS or greater on ultra settings. DLSS and ray tracing are basically useless at this point even on a 2080 Ti since there is literally 2 games that use the tech and some would argue doing so not properly. However if a $1250 MSRP does not scare you off and you want the best of the best than yeah the XC Ultra is a great card since it's a three slot card but has the size of a 2.75 card yet has a massive cooler that in my experience keeps gaming under 70 degrees (I have been averaging 67-68), and at 10.6"" in length the card at least length wise can fit into many cases.",2019-02-07 12:34:00

I've never had to use it yet and this is my second identical card as I'm going for dual card built. I've heard good things about them.  ,Cons: The pump. See below if you want to read a story.  ,"Overall Review: This is my second card of the same make and model. The first card is happily in a custom loop now, and I have an unused ""hybrid cooler"" in my drawer that I cannot flip online because of the great 3-year warranty (return card the way you bought it).  My first card had a really loud whining sound from the AIO pump and it is a known issue among EVGA forumers. My first rig didn't have the headers to split out the PWM control of the AIO fan and the VRM fan so I stuck a magnet under the pump to align the impeller to make the sound go away.  This second card is very quiet compared to the first card. The pump is still audible but it's at the level of those other AIOs using Asetek's pump like the H55. I don't use the supplied fan because my case needs the slim 15mm fan so I use a Noctua.  Performance - The card at stock hits 52C open-case running at 100% utilization. I'm able to overclock it to 2080MHz, maxing out the 17% XC VBIOS power headroom, doing 65C in the case. Once under my custom loop, I got to 2100MHz easily at 50C. This card is no FTW3 but for a reference PCB, you get a lot of PCB+VRM+chip. Couple the AIO cooling with Boost 4.0 and you have a winner here. If you get one with a silent pump. :)  During the removal of the shroud from the first card, I noticed that the pump bracket is very similar to that of a NZXT Kraken G12 and the pump is no different from other Asetek generics. I may one day try to see if I can swap out the pump with a H55 or even better, a compatible pump with 240mm radiator.  Installation - Just a short note about the radiator.

I'm not really into overclocking and I'm concerned with thermals in my situation so you might be able to do more with this card or another one to push it to these specs or beyond but I will say it works great for what it is.  Priced pretty well compared to other 3 fan cards and cards with similar clock speeds. In many cases it's the cheapest option for factory 1845mhz with good cooling.  White design fit the theme of my build. Wish there were more video card options in white!  ","Cons: If you are using this for extremely heavy loads and expect 90% or more utilization for long periods of time that you would normally only get from benchmarking and maybe running games at max on 4K for several hours you will probably want to play with the fan settings a bit. In my testing the card did not want to get past 70% fan speed by default and seemed to keep to 70-80C probably to balance for sound. Probably within spec of the card but for best long term performance especially if you don't have great thermals in your case you will probably want to crank up the fan speed.  I also find the RGB lighting a bit lacking, it only covers the Gigabyte logo on the side of the card which is pretty small and pointless. It would have been nice to also have RGB on the backplate logo at least as well. Though I suppose there are other options from Gigabyte if that is important to you. Personally I'm not super into Gigabyte's RGB lighting manager either as most of my build run on other managers.  ","Overall Review: Overall this is a good card with good performance and has a price competitive with the competition. I don't think the cons are worth knocking an egg off but I'd probably do a half egg if I could for 4.5/5.  Just a side note from what I have seen while planning my build for a few months before, these white Gigabyte cards seem to not be super well stocked on Newegg or other websites so I'd recommend buying them as soon as you see them if you really want a factory card already in white.",2019-12-29 19:39:00

Running on a Gigabyte Designare Z390. Very happy.  ","Cons: You do need to know going in (and I did) that the pump does make a constant background noise. Mine is the normal noise (not the more problematic air bubble noise)--quieter than the fans when gaming, but louder than a premium fan system at idle. I'm not taking any points off for the noise since I knew about it ahead of time and it's actually less intrusive than I was expecting. I do have to say though that it seems to be capable of pumping out a lot of heat, which, of course, is the point.

From most people who have this card, you should expect to get temps from around 55C-60C .I’ve had this card for about a month and it’s been awesome. The only thing is if you buy this card, make sure to follow the instructions it comes with on where to place the radiator to get the best possible performance. Overall, only reason I’m giving this card 4/5 is for the price it should look a little bit better. I would recommend getting this card, but try getting it when it’s on sale!",2019-09-26 15:09:00

I use a 4K 144Hz refresh rate monitor which this card is best suited for, in my opinion. My current game of choice is F1 2019 where I see a 30 fps increase in minimum fps at times. Not to mention all of the graphical upgrades related to AA with this card in some games, it's a joy to use. The card runs very quiet even under heavy load and I don't see major core clock downclocking when temps rise, which is nice.  ","Cons: I would like to have seen a larger 240mm radiator with this card. I understand that this could cannibalize sales of the Kingpin Edition card, though. I don't think a 120mm radiator is enough to cool this card if you game at 4K @ 144Hz.  EVGA Precision X1 did not work well for me. Caused crashing in benchmarking software before it even fully started up, at complete stock settings. Core and memory temperature are also higher for me under load compared to when I use another major brand's utility. For some reason X1 causes a higher load on the GPU compared to the other brand's utility, and I also scored higher in benchmarks without Precision. Usually I'm a big fan of Precision software, hopefully updates will resolve whatever was going on with my system and I'll re-install. Strange.  ","Overall Review: Overall I am very happy with this card. Running the card with an i9 9900K and 4K 144Hz G-sync monitor, this combo is gaming bliss. Hybrid cooler is very much worth it. I didn't go into it expecting a miracle over air cooling. Just wanted a bit quieter of an experience with less down clocking under gaming load. And the card delivers. I've settled on a modest core offset of +125 for gaming, which gives me a core clock range of 2040mhz - 2100mhz, depending on temperature and power. It never goes below 2000mhz.  The voltage slider does nothing for me; I can still hit the same speed with the same core offset, just at slightly cooler temps by leaving it alone, which is great. My case is small, a Corsair 400c, so maybe I could squeeze more out of this card with some more air flow.  Buyers should be aware, this card runs HOT if you game at 4K @ 144Hz. My settings above after 3 hours of F1 2019 at ultra and highest AA (this card takes things beyond TAA in this game, it is truly stunning) resulted in a max core temp of 74C, which is still under the 88C threshold. For comparison, when I tried the game at 4K @ 60Hz my max core temp was only 55C. So if you game at 60Hz heat should be much less of an issue.",2019-08-08 21:35:00

I've never experienced such nor any coil whines.  ,"Cons: Card is quite bulky. Radiator hoses could have been a bit more flexible and longer. Could have used more RGB on the card plate for vertical card mounting. Card used to reach around the mid 70's celcius on full load until I've remounted the radiator as shown on the package installation instruction(quite tricky). I also added an extra fan for a push pull configuration. This however comes with a compromise to overall case aesthetics if you're looking for a clean looking setup. I also did not receive any posters or bonus games for paying such a premium. nonetheless, I'm happy with the product.  ",Overall Review: It would have been more helpful if card installation instruction were more highly stressed. I've had to experiment with quite many radiator positions in order to optimize cooling efficiency. It would also be great if the hybrid kit including the fan and radiator were more aesthetically appealing. Radiator hoses are pretty stubborn to be moved around. EVGA should really introduce options to mount the radiator much flexibly . They should also provide instructions about overclocking to safe numbers that would not hurt the card.,2019-05-21 02:06:00

This GPU is a beast for both 4K 60fps gaming as well as any work loads that can utilize those CUDA cores ad Tensor cores. Power draw is pretty decent as well. EVGA did a good job in supporting this GPU. Mine was the first batch shipped with older BIOS. Then got a +30% power limit BIOS from EVGA forum right away, which allows the GPU to sit around ~1950MHz core when over clocked. I can go on for a while for the pros but you might as well read the reviews.  Something good that not a lot of review sites mentioned though:  EVGA offers a free trim kit after you register the GPU. Precision X1 gets very good support. I see new versions coming out almost every 2 weeks.  ","Cons: This specific cooler is not as beefy as the XC Ultra or the FTW3. The card does gets fairly hot (~85C) when both core and vram are overclocked.  Althouth EVGA is really committed to support Precision X1. I would not recommend using it to overclock or set fan curve, at least for now. Many bugs still need to worked out. Wait until X1 gets to at least 0.5.0 version.  The last con is the lack of RTX applications. I haven't found much use for the RTX engines on the Turing silicon.

The small 11GB VRAM does limit the usefulness of this in ML applications quite a bit though  Overall if you want the best in gaming and also happen to be a programmer this card will serve you will. Personally I am waiting for either EKWB's MLC water block or EVGA's own hybrid kit. Putting the 2080Ti under water will more than likely curb the temperature issue.  As always, I will update the review once I have more time with the card. So far I am pleased with my purchase. This is what a top of the line state of the art GPU should be.  BTW: Take whatever being spread across the web of ""RTX are dying"" ""news"" with a truck load of salt. Remember, owners of functional cards tend not to be vocal. While the small minority who experienced card death may be way more vocal. That along with the echo chamber of social media can easily blow things out of proportion. I for one is very happy with my 2080Ti. And EVGA's customer service definitely gives me peace of mind as well.",2018-11-27 17:23:00

Woah framerate choking, and another DirectX error. That was under my Windows 7 partition. Boot into the Windows 10. Same problem. Tried Asus's firmware update, more nVidia driver updates, run the DirectX update from BF4, underclock the card, nothing's helping. RMA'd the card, and a week later I'm up and running for round two. Runs great for a day, then the same problems return. I move this 2nd card to another gaming rig with a brand new EVGA 850W PSU. I do a fresh install of Win 10. After Windows updates to v1803, and installs nVidia drivers I start seeing funky anomalies in the video. Then it does the Win 10 version of a blue screen with an error that's referring to video problems. Pull out the RTX 2080 TI, drop in my Titan, and the PC is happy. On to RMA round two. Now where'd I put that shipping box?  ","Overall Review: So, the third card came in. This one seems to be good to go. Several weeks of service now without failure. If you get a good one, you'll love it. I'd be sure you have a backup card on hand to keep you in service, and lots of patience.

(It's insanely easy to swap profiles while gaming I haven't not had issues doing so when I want high FPS on BF5 for a little bit)  ,"Cons: - This card will sag it's heavy for sure I made a small prop up using some straws and electrical tape to give it a lift. - Default settings with heavy load runs hot like instant 80C temps consistently. - GPU Tweak will need to apply your custom setting on startup other wise it will revert back to default ""Gaming"" setting which will run hot. I suggest you install it and configure it to startup and apply the profile you want on startup. - GPU Tweak OSD crashes some games and will close applications like discord when turned on. FYI their is a blacklist you can setup but it took me a little to figure that out so expect turning on the OSD feature to close your game or some apps running.  ",Overall Review: - If you don't mind taking the time to setup a custom profile for lower temps sure. - 100% power at 85C temp but I found it just stays at 80C while heavy gaming at least. - I set 2 custom profiles one for 55% power at around 70C temps and another for 80% and 77C temps I find the lower one seems to work just fine for long WoW sessions. 80% does get loud and temps climb but it does it's job and I honestly don't notice a big drop in FPS running ultra settings. I've notice some weird sounds like a fuzzing audio is playing but I think it's just the fans they do get loud at higher speeds. - Gaming mode is a power house and plays BF 5 great at ultra but will stay at 80C pretty much the whole time. - The low db mode is nice fans don't run under temp threshold but only expect while idle and web browsing/watching youtube. Put any game on I was seeing roughly a low of 55C to a steady 64C - 70C climbs. - I highly suggest you use GPU Tweak and configure a lower power input profile it's easy to configure and create profiles to play with and switch them is easier. At least you can control how hot and fast this card runs.,2019-01-09 06:47:00

I was very worried when i got this card originally because of the temps, but I WAS ABLE TO FIX the problem using their GPU Tweak II. This is unacceptable that the card would come stock with this setting.  It was set to only have the fans start spinning @ 50% of their maximum speed when the card reached EIGHTY degrees Celsius, never allowing them to even spin at 100% speed. Once I fixed the fan speed issue, I could run Path of Exile @ 69C stable. (all settings maxxed 1440p, the game has no frame limiter so its pushing 250-340fps, thus why it was overusing and overheating the card). Rocket League runs at 53C stable. Acceptable.

Card could not handle any load (in the games I play) without horrific performance. Appears to be no fix and none of the AMD drivers for the last year fixed the problem.  ","Overall Review: AMD appears to have created a graphics card that was not actually market ready. I spent hours working on fixing it, I tried at least 10 different drivers (yes, including the newest one), spent time in forums, wrote to the company, attempted turning graphics all to minimum, and ran several diagnostic tests on my computer. I unistalled all drivers and re-installed them. I checked other components and software for possible update issues. I went so far as to replace my RAM (it was under performing but was not the problem). Nothing I could think of and nothing I could find on google, youtube, the company website, or any forums had any help for the plethora of people having issues with these new RX 5700 series cards.  I have been a dedicated AMD and Radeon customer for over a decade but this product is enough that I will be upgrading to a different brand. Last year I made the switch to intel due to cpu issues in multiple AMD cpus. This year it looks like I'll be making another switch... Very disappointed. Something that costs this much should function properly out of the box and should not be put on the market until it is ready. I wish I could charge AMD for the amount of time I spent trying to make this thing work properly.  System specs: Intel core I7-7700 AMD RX 480 (MSI-8GB) Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3000 C15 2x8GB Plenty of free space on HD   While trying to fix the RX 5700, I discovered that the newer radeon drivers were actually causing my RX 480 to have similar (although not as bad) issues. I rolled back to 19.8.1, hiked up the fan and used global wattman to slightly increase performance and am now at least able to play the more graphic intense games again without the stuttering and lagging I was getting before.

After heavy testing, peak temps reached 61C. After gaming for about an hour, peak temps were 53-55C. Mundane use temps stay near idle at 30C. - Quiet: The AIO keeps the hottest part of the card cooler, which means it's quieter. I'm using a push/pull for the radiator, and sound is audible under heavy load, but not excessive. The memory and VRMs are air cooled by the card fan. It is unnoticeable as far as noise. - Stable: Due to being cooler, the frequency stability is excellent. With no overclock and 130% power delivery using EVGA Precision, the card stabilizes at 1985Mhz with peaks at 2010Mhz.  ","Cons: - Price: Obviously an expensive card. - Initial coil whine and noise: The pump was audible for about the first half-hour after install, but has been quiet since. There is occasional coil whine, again more after first install, but not much since. - RTX logo on the side has EVGA logo LEDs underneath it that do not match up with the RTX logo. It looks like a poor implemented design that was added as an afterthought. - RTX: Not much going on with this as of the time of this review, so purchasing a card for RTX is a gamble.  ","Overall Review: I bought this card from another vendor because Newegg didn't have it at the time. I am coming from a GTX 1080 to this, and the performance improvement is drastic, sometimes +100% increases in certain games and benchmarks. Overall, at 1440p I can generally max out settings and keep framerates above 100fps.  The card is very expensive, but if you are looking to purchase this, I would recommend.

I have run this card for two weeks at 4k resolution or just under and it stays very cool - under 60 c- usually just at or over 50 c. I have not overclocked it so I can not report on ultra super settings. I just use the max settings in most of my games and it handles it without a hitch.  The VR port is a definite plus.  As you can see I am very satisfied at 5 out of 5.  ",Cons: The card is about 1.2 cm longer than expected. Measure your case.  There is separately sold adapter that moves the power plugs from the front of the card to the inside edge close to the disk stack. If you have a small case this adapter may not fit.

I also have not done the bios flash to 5700xt but I might do it for the extra frames and update this.  ,Cons: No cons so far drivers are running good and card is not overheating. My case has two exhaust and two intake fans in my nzxt s340.  ,Overall Review: If you're debating getting this take my review into account it's a decent card and with bios might get really close to 5700xt. Runs most games maxed out at 1440p even with a ryzen 1600,2020-04-05 17:44:00

I set a custom fan curve to keep things even cooler. - Fairly compact size, able to fit almost any case. - Understated, yet classy looking (Subjective, I know)  ","Cons: These cons are minor, but worth considering.  - Only one 8 pin power connector may limit overclocking if you flash with the XT bios. - Only a single bios.

We know they work and are still current, and I get to upgrade. So this MSI 5700 Evoke is such an upgrade. Installing/running the display software was easy and there has not been an iota of graphic problems. I've been waiting for AMD or their partners to quiet down and get temperatures under control, and the Evoke is a good result. The metal body acts as a heat sink and is just better than the plastic bodies that most cards have. It would be nice if it simply had a demure LED logo or such, so if you want bling you won't like this card. Game sound is fine, but Windows sound has been a little glitchy. Don't know why yet. The card is connected to an HTR via HDMI as I've been doing for the last few cards. That works, just not quite perfectly.",2020-03-15 09:33:00

It's perfect for what I needed it for. Great combination with my monitor for 1080p and 1440p gaming. However, recently I've been having lots of problems that are making me regret my purchase. For one, I've had multiple instances where I launch a game, and it crashes back to windows. I first thought this could be a RAM problem, but after doing a RAM check and updating my graphics card to the newest RX 5700 drivers, I still had this problem. As problems persisted, it constantly happened to me where I would launch a game, it would freeze, and my monitor would turn black and say ""no signal"". Not only did this frustrate me a lot, as unplugging the DisplayPort cable and replugging it back in didn't do anything, but also the sound still worked so I knew it was a graphics card problem! At least twice a day I have to hard reset my PC in order to successfully run a game. Not to mention, I chose this graphics card to have high specs when playing VR, which I recently purchased this holiday, and it's disappointing that I can't go one day without a crash or freeze occurring. I'm really disappointed in MSI and the overall situation. Hopefully somebody can help me out.  Thanks",2019-12-31 19:00:00

Here are some examples: My current Undervolt/UV: (stage5:1350MHz@1025mV, stage6:1385MHz@1050mV, stage7:1420MHz@1050mV / Power Limit:+50% ) -MSI Kombustor combined benchmark preset 1080 (ran three times): UV(5567 points, 93 FPS, max temp@57, max wattage: 156W) vs out of box(5528 points, 92 FPS, max temp@69, max wattage: 183W) -Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark: UV(4337 points, Graphic test 1 29.22 FPS, Graphic test 2 24.18 FPS,max temp@50, max wattage: 141W) vs out of box(4357 points, Graphic test 1 29.39 FPS, Graphic test 2 24.26 FPS,max temp@68, max wattage: 183W) -Superposition 1080P Extreme: UV(2574 points, avg 19.26 FPS, max temp@51, max wattage: 141W) vs out of box(2587 points, avg 19.35 FPS, max temp@69, max wattage: 182W) -Unigine Heaven 1080P Ultra / Tessellation Extreme: UV(1370 points, avg 54.4 FPS, max temp@50, max wattage: 126W) vs Out of box(1376 points, avg 54.6 FPS, max temp@75, max wattage: 169W) The power consumption was one of my biggest concern as my PSU is only 500W (gold) but I believe this graphics card will be able to handle upcoming games without stressing the PSU too much. I highly recommend this graphics card!",2019-02-03 12:56:00

I decided to order *this* card only because the more widely-reviewed/approved 5600 XT options were out of stock virtually everywhere at the time. I figured the performance can't vary *that* drastically, and I'm honestly not that particular regardless.  On the note of performance, this card certainly puts out. However, and this is a huge however, a card's performance isn't worth much if it's unstable. Which this card is. Extremely. Out-of-the-box settings, clean install on a brand new rig, and this card would crash about every 20 minutes to an hour under moderate load. Want to run a low-settings game on one monitor and watch Youtube on the other? Not with this card, at least not without a lot of headaches.  It took about two weeks of troubleshooting, researching, consulting AMD community members, etc for me to get this thing to run stable, and I'm honestly not even sure if it's actually stable now, just that it hasn't crashed in the last two days. I couldn't even tell you what potentially ""fixed"" it as I've tried so many freakin' things to get it to this point of stability - Although it seems to be a combination of disabling hardware acceleration on Chrome/Discord and only running the card on the silent BIOS settings that did the trick. So, at the very least, if you decide to get this card, don't expect to be able to run it at the out-of-the-box performance BIOS (which is kind of the only reason you'd want to get it anyway). The only reason I haven't returned this forsaken thing is because the box got mistakenly tossed in the bin at some point, so I'm pretty much stuck with this problem child of a GPU.  And the thing is, I'm honestly not sure how much, if at all, XFX or its design for this card is at fault for these issues. The biggest takeaway I've had from this experience is that A LOT of 5600/5700 XT cards have been having these exact same issues pretty much since release, with no clear fix or solution in sight, and radio silence from AMD in regards to these issues. Knowing now what I do about the RX 5600 XT, I can't recommend anyone get one. Apparently it's a complete gamble, regardless of which exact card you get, whether or not it will run stable.  I'll be shopping Nvidia in the future. I've heard that the 2060 KO Ultra is about the same performance for a similar price, without all the driver/BIOS issues.",2020-05-05 11:39:00

Anthem - 3440x1440 - Ultra Settings and HBAO+ - Anywhere from 70 to 100fps (Gsync Monitor Refresh Cap)  Shadow of the Tomb Raider - 80+ Ultra Preset Benchmark result  It is a capable card. Build wise, the Strix looks clean and I noticed no issue with sag on the PCI E Slot.  ","Cons: Two Issues:  Coil Whine - As soon as I installed and fired up, a noticeable coil whine note. This is not unheard of, and I decided to not RMA right off the bat; I wanted to play some new games on the horizon, like Anthem.  Drive Hangs/Crashing/Instability: Left the card at factory clocks (Left in Game Mode with ASUS GPU Tweak II) These symptoms took about a week, maybe two, to develop. I have been traveling quite a bit for work, so my gaming time has been reduced, but still managed a few marathon sessions once Anthem released.  Starting around the 24th of February, card purchased around the beginning of February, I started noticing more and more in game frame hangups; never looked at the event viewer logs to see if the driver was stopping and recovering, no errors were generated at the desktop level. I chalked these hitches to the software, Anthem has been plagued with performance and server instability itself. Eventually this behavior resulted in full on crashes, and eventually a hard crash out of Windows (no BSOD).  I encountered through Direct X errors, all referencing Driver hangs, bad calls, texture calls, etc.  From here I moved to troubleshooting mode. It seemed, through googling and searching the Anthem forums/reddit, that I was not the only person seeing these, so I started with the game first. Repair, Uninstall/Reinstall, Direct X runtime repair/reinstall, Drivers, etc. No luck, so I switched gears and started looking to prove the card faulty. Downloaded Heaven DX11 and 3DMark for DX12 - They both test differently. No issue, or at least no crash or apparent artifacting during the 3DMark tests. The Heaven DX11 tests however revealed that it is indeed an issue with the card. Reminder, this card is running as is from the factory. I had one successful pass on Heaven, but noticed artifacting, I would describe the appearance as oil on water blotching all over the screen. On the second test, a hang, the third, a crash that could be repeated and predicted at the same segment of the benchmark. The only troubleshooting at this point I did, and I still planned to RMA, was clocking the card down on memory and gpu; 500MHz across the board. This did not have any impact on the artifacting or crashing in Heaven.  GPU temps reported through Tweak II showed thermals well within limits on the silicon; peak temp was 74* C   TLDR:  Coil Whine from Factory - worsened over time and during max load on the card was fairly audible Eventual instability and crashing  ","Overall Review: I went into this knowing the risks with the RTX lineup of cards. Read around, ASUS is not the only board partner facing this issue. In fact, I still trust ASUS and will continue to use them for my other components, MOBO, Monitors, etc.  If you push forward with purchasing, look at the reviews around me and know that you might get a lemon. If you do purchase, I hope your luck was better than mine.",2019-02-27 19:47:00

I did file a support ticket, but so far all I've received is directions on how to install the drivers. Not helpful, but maybe for someone else it is.  I get the blue light, but it leave my monitor blank. Doesn't matter which port I use. (DVI, HDMI, Display.) I've done all the uninstalling of other drivers, installing the newest driver. I've tried older versions of the driver, etc. I have tried out fresh builds with a blank version of Windows 10 and windows 8.1(found they didn't even make a driver for 8.1). I was really excited about this card, but later I looked at more reviews and apparently this card has a history of taking a dump out of the box. And I'm feeling that.  -:EDIT:-  I was able to grab another card from a friend. Same exact model. Slid it into the port and powered up the system. It immediately worked and is running great! I have not received any feedback since from xfx support about the other card (which, in my mind, is obviously a lemon.) I'll update this as soon I get more info.

Why you ask? #1: I payed extra for the rush processing that didn't happen. #2: I payed extra for 3 day shipping that didn't happen 5 days to get here for a card that don't work. So I guess I am out the money I spent on top of the price of the card. And I guess I will contact radeon support and see if they can talk me thru the problems or start RMA procedures and wait another 30 days for a new card. But I have heard horror stories of people getting refurbished cards cards back when they sent their's in for RMA. All I know is I spent hard earned money on something that didn't work got ripped off by paying for a service I DIDN'T get and have to wait even longer possibly to get another card that might or might not work.

I thought it was just the outside Newegg box, but when I opened it, I found that the graphics card box also had damage on the corner. Inside of that box, I found the corner also damaged.

","Overall Review: Honestly, it seems like a great product. Coming from an MSI R9 series that was released WAAAAY before AMD Wattman, it provided overclock speeds by using an MSI utility (MSI Gaming Utility), so this being used with Wattman means that there is a little bit of learning curve. Out of the box, it looks like it will get some great FPS, but I think with a little bit of time and patience, I can possibly push a little more out of it.

Never even tried to OC the card at all since I couldn't even get it to run longer then 5 mins in a game without crashing my system. XFX support was very slow in responding to tickets. Almost 2 full days from my ticket submission until I got a first response. Advised I try using a driver that was over a year old. Which sure that worked somewhat, but still had crashes. When I asked why I had to use a year old driver to get his card to work then I was told I should probably RMA it as it was likely defective. XFX straight up told me I was better off contacting newegg rather then sending it back to them because the process would take weeks to get a different card and that they would send me a refurbished card in return. Yeah, no thanks. I'm not paying $300 for a refurbished card!

Follow the instructions in the included manual. - Driver disk included, although you should download from AMD's site to ensure that you get the most up-to-date drivers. - Excellent build quality  ","Cons: - None that come to mind, so far, aside from being able to buy one.  ","Overall Review: I installed this in a new build, and it replaces an XFX Radeon RX 550 4GB card that I had bought a couple of months ago. Physically, the RX 580 is much larger. The RX 550 looks like a card from the early 2000s in comparison. Motherboard: ASRock X370 Taichi. CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700X.  Because of the size and length of the card, I had to reroute a couple of cables, as well as the tubes for my CPU cooling system.  Seating the card took a bit of time. The most difficult part of the installation was installing the retaining screws. One went in fine, and the other I dropped no less than five times with the screw falling into the card each time. Don't worry, the computer had been powered down and was unplugged.  This card, like many modern card, takes up two slots in the back of the computer. With most features being built into the computer, that's not a huge issue today.  Get a beefy power supply. You'll also need an 8-pin power supply connector. Most power supplies have that.  With the card installed, I powered up the computer. If the LED on the card glows red, you have a problem. If it glows blue, everything is good. Mine glowed blue.  I booted into Linux. No problem. Powered down and booted into Windows 10. The screen was flashing, so I uninstalled the AMD drivers and reinstalled a new set, which I believe were the same drivers. Rebooted, and no more screen flashes.  So far, I'm very pleased with the performance. I'm using the CUDA ability of the card to render video. I haven't gamed with it yet.  The fans haven't yet turned on, as they don't need to. I haven't stressed the card enough.  I live in Linux most of the time and haven't had any issues with it. Videos play nicely. The screen seems snappy (that is helped a lot by the CPU and RAM).  I'd like to install the AMD Linux drivers, but that was a nightmare the last time that I did that.  I bought this on Monday for $259 with a $30 rebate. By Wednesday, they were all sold out.",2017-12-22 13:18:00

Doesn't feel brittle or flimsy in your hands. - Backplate makes installing or removing the card easy, and looks nice. - A very handsome-looking card overall. Minimalistic design works with most cases. - Only requires a single 8-pin power connector. - Powers through pretty much any game I throw at it with minimal slowdown. - Price is good (see ""other"" section). - Extra VRAM helps with future-proofing. - Better at DX12 and Vulcan games, in general.  ","Cons: - Only a modest overclock from the factory. (Can go higher by manually tuning it yourself). - Nitpicking: very small imperfections in some of the metalwork on the cooler. - Requires more juice than competition (non-issue for me, see ""other"")  ","Overall Review: Bought this as a replacement for my GTX 680 that I've had since 2012, which recently started to show its age.  I haven't bought a red team card since they were still ATi, so I wasn't sure exactly what I would get with this purchase. Last I knew was the HD4850, which was a ludicrously powerful card for the pricepoint, though ATi's drivers were pretty bleh and unstable. I am happy to say this card exceeded my expectations so far.  =-Performance-= I did lots of benchmark research, and made some rough estimations of what kind of performance I'd get; does slightly better. It runs everything I ask of it very nicely, with only optimization causing slowdown in some games. Run everything on max, and most games I run around 60 FPS consistently, some exceptions being PUBG and Squad (again, those games have optimization issues). The 8 GB of VRAM will allow you to keep this card for longer, as that extra memory is key with newer and newer titles. Also, this card has better DX12 and Vulcan support, another future-proof plus.  =-OC-= I have yet to overclock the card myself, but I expect to get around 1425-1450 MHz out of it, given my case's good airflow.  =-Temps & Power-= Idle temps are around 40C, haven't checked under load. This card has a lower TDP, aftermarket cooler, and runs cooler than my previous card though, so for me the issues some have with this card being ""too hot and power hungry"" are moot; it's more efficient than my last card.  =-Drivers-= As I mentioend, last I knew of red team drivers was that they were very unstable. I am happy to say that thus far, the drivers haven't given me any major grief. They were simple to install and work just fine. The only minor annoyance is that they install an ""AMD HD audio"" driver with the video drivers, and it ended up screwing with the motherboard's Realtek audio drivers, and lowered the audio quality/reset my equalizer settings or something. Had to reinstall the Realtek drivers to get my sound back to normal.  =-Price-= Probably the biggest thing about this card was/is its price. This card, as I'm sure most reading this know, is an object of lust for cryptocurrency miners, and as such this card has been facing supply and demand issues for its entire existence. When it was released, it was around $320-340 CAD. As of this review, the card is regularly priced at $444. The only reason I bought this card was that I found it going for about $340 after rebate on Cyber Monday, something which I waited months for, not knowing if prices would ever come down that far. Prices are still routinely in the $400-500 range, which is way too much for the performance you're getting, imo.   tl;dr: If you can snag this card for somewhere close to the MSRP, I highly recommend it. It's well-built, works fine and performs great, looks very nice, and is more future proof than its competition. This card has mostly 5 star reviews and I can see why.

There are no Bells and Whistles with this card, which I'm listing as a ""Pro"" because I didn't want all that bloatware and stuff, because I don't use it.

",Cons: 0  ,"Overall Review: Got in on sale for $239 which was my target price. If you have a case with poor ventilation, you'll want to create a custom fan profile (MSI afterburner) but you knew this because it is an AMD.  Much better value than what the competitively priced competition offers. When compared to a 1060 6GB it performs on par, slightly better in some titles, a little lower in others, but there is isn't the screen tearing with the 580 on the same hardware plus CPU usage tends to be much lower running those same titles; %15 less on average. It has always bugged me that Nvidia offloads to the CPU, but that is a way to build cards that have lower power requirements, lower thermals as a result and over inflate performance.  After a few months now I can say it was a great purchase especially for the price. It is on par with a Sapphire 590 in Fortnite and PUBG at the same settings. I manually set the fan curve for gaming to go to 75% once the card reaches 60C and hardly ever does it make it to 70C at that fan speed even after a multi hour session.  People who have heating issues aren't dissipating heat soon enough and/or have poor case ventilation. Set fan curve to be more aggressive and it'll never have to run at 100%",2019-03-23 08:07:00

","Overall Review: I bought this card for a small gaming rig. The first week after build and many different driver downloads they card worked great for about 3 hours, at which time started to flicker. The card then froze up, multi colored lines across the screen. After several hard restarts the display came back. Support told me it was my HDMI cable, which it wasn't, so i bought another one, the one support suggested, few hours in froze again. Several hours and days of research on google come to find out everyone having same issue with this card. I was told a fix was to set the wattman to 50, after reverting back to last driver. I did, hour later crush. and all setting went back to default. I was told to disable Updates and MSI afterburner. again no luck. Called support again and got nothing we can do, your card is fine attitude. After several more days of tweaking and downloading different drivers i actually got it to work for more then 3 hours on a game. But would still crash. Normal browser had no issue. watching 4k movies it would flicker, watching 1080 movies would flicker from time to time but not as bad. Even youtube videos would crash it after awhile.

Totally safe!! - Make sure you measure the space inside your case before ordering - it's a pretty big card! - Make sure you have a big enough rated PSU with 1 x 8 pin power connector.,2019-09-26 14:43:00

At the time it was going for nearly 170 dollars and was comparable in price to 4 GB models. This card does what it is supposed to do. It playes games well at 1080p60, and you can crank up the settings decently far before you run into drops below 60. You can even max out a few titles if you want.   It is clear the cooler is quite cheap as there are parts on the front of the card still exposed while there is no backplate at all. \The MK2 addresses this but the front part of the cooler still doesn't quite cover everything.  This card runs a tad warm, and the stock fan curve is terrible, at least if you max out the power slider, which I'd recommend. It has to ramp up the fans to 3000 rpm at otherwise stock settings to keep it at 60. You can turn it off though and set a much less aggressive one. Mine run at roughly 1700-1800 RPM and keep the card under 70 degrees, usually sitting at mid 60s under load, 70 being the peak it hits.  I recently saw an 8 GB RX 580 from Sapphire with a backplate and a nice cooler for less than what I paid, and it normally goes for 180. I'd highly recommend spending a little bit more money on a nicer card than cheaping out this much. However, if your budget is that tight, and you need a solid 1080p card, this is the one for you.",2019-08-11 14:56:00

I had the exact same issue, only I did a proper troubleshoot before leaving a negative review. ***IMPORTANT***: CHECK YOUR POWER SUPPLY. This card uses slightly more power than a typical GPU. Everyone says they have tried everything without success, yet NO ONE MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT THE POWER CONSUMPTION. If your power supply is less than 600-650W, you are going to need a better one, hands down. GPU's only use as much power as they need in the moment, depending on the load. The higher the load (ie. playing a graphically intensive game vs. checking your e-mail), the GPU uses more and more power as it is needed. If your power supply doesn't have enough power for the GPU while it is handling heavier loads, your power supply shuts off because you have exceeded the ""ceiling"" of how much power is available . That is your PC shutting off, not the card.  TL:DR - Make sure your PC has enough power to supply to the GPU before bothering MSi with an RMA and leaving a nasty review. The cards aren't DOA, the people using them are. Learn some basic computer knowledge and logic before automatically blaming them!!!!",2019-06-27 13:47:00

This is my first Nvidia card, so I was extremely happy being able to plug it in, install drivers, and be off to the races within 10 minutes. I chose this card because of the driver issues AMD has been having, I don't have the patience to sit and troubleshoot, and the small drop in performance to the RX 5700 XT is fine with me. Typical air-cooled setup, card runs very cool compared to other cards I've owned, in fact it was really surprising seeing it only hit 55°C when I first plugged it in and booted up a game. I don't play really demanding titles (ESO, FFXIV, CSGO, Minecraft), but it was a significant difference to my RX480. Perhaps because I haven't really pushed the card I haven't heard coil whine, but it's been utter silence since I put it in.

This is my first Nvidia card, so I was extremely happy being able to plug it in, install drivers, and be off to the races within 10 minutes. I chose this card because of the driver issues AMD has been having, I don't have the patience to sit and troubleshoot, and the small drop in performance to the RX 5700 XT is fine with me. Typical air-cooled setup, card runs very cool compared to other cards I've owned, in fact it was really surprising seeing it only hit 55°C when I first plugged it in and booted up a game. I don't play really demanding titles (ESO, FFXIV, CSGO, Minecraft), but it was a significant difference to my RX480. Perhaps because I haven't really pushed the card I haven't heard coil whine, but it's been utter silence since I put it in. Also shoutout to being one of the few cards out there with DL-DVI-D, I have an older BenQ that requires it for 144hz.

In that time, I had 1 instance of the game I was playing (World of Tanks) just turn black. I could ctrl+alt+delete to desktop and task manager and shut off game.  a few nights ago my monitor simply turned off while I was surfing. It said No signal.  5 Times tonight, approx every hour while gaming the same thing happens. The monitor goes black, says no signal and goes to sleep.  Every time this happens, I have to reboot at least once to get the monitor to wake up.  I have the latest drivers (actually went to nvidia and redownloaded and installed)  Power supply is a Mushkin 850. Plenty of power.  I was happy for a few days, but am regretting this card now. Wondering if I should return it and get something other than an EVGA card or move to AMD instead.  I would definitely not recommend this card to EVGA to a friend or enemy at this point.   ***** End update*******   My old set up was: i7 3770k 16GB Patriot Viper 1600 RAM PNY 560 ti P8Z77-V Pro mobo  I used to play a lot of Battlefield 3 and some 4 with it. I did a lot of World of Tanks, too. Since the latter is what I primarily play now, I will use that as my reference point.  Because the CPU/mobo also had video on it, I generally ran WOT on high/ultra settings. Until a gforce update I did a month ago, I was still getting 80-90FPS. After the update (not sure why), my FPS dropped to 40-50. I had to lower some of my settings to high or for some medium. Then I got about 60fps, occasionally dropping to around 47 in some battle situations.  New Setup: Ryzen 7 3700 (no onboard video) 32GB G.Skill Ripjaws 3600 This card (EVGA RTX 2060 Super SC Ultra Gaming) Asus x570 TUF gaming mobo  Day 1, you could definitely smell the new card. :) The gforce software updated my games for me. It put everything in WOT on Ultra settings. I loaded into the game and was hitting over 200fps.  Last night I did have 1 instance, in the middle of a match, my screen went black. I could get out of the game and get to the rest of my computer. I had to ctrl+alt-del the game closed then restart it (to be dead of course) so not sure if it was a game issue or something with the card. That's 1 time out of probably 150-200 matches.  After a few hours of playing, I noticed my fps dropped to the 150-170 range. I'm guessing it may be a tad slower as it heats up, because it seems to be the same every day. HOWEVER, other than when I boot my computer, I still have not heard the card fans kick into high. They are actually quieter than the stock fan that came with the CPU--which is fairly quiet...a nice, soothing white noise.  My case is an Antec 900 and this card barely fits once the hard drives are in their bays. But it fits.  So far, I am loving this card. I don't see a terrible amount of difference between old and new set up graphically, though there is some. I need to DL the HD version of WOT and get a 2k monitor now. LOL  I have ZERO whine and, as I have said, it is a quiet card.  I also like the GeForce overlay (press Alt+z for it). It gives me the ability to record or stream live games. It's easy to use. I only tried it once or twice. I haven't figured out how to get it to record from my mic for commentary at the same time, but I'm sure that's nothing a quick search can't fix.  Overall, I am VERY pleased with this. I would definitely recommend to a friend as it will probably be future proof for quite some time to come.  I will probably update soon as a follow up...definitely update if something goes wrong.",2020-05-04 16:17:00

Remember this is a mining review. I do not benchmark based on FPS. This card out of the box performs about the same as a 1060 3GB card but using a good bit more power. I have bought a handful of other brands with the same memory type as this card I received and they perform better. Stock : MSI on Ethereum would go from 23-26 MH/s out of the box. This card would only get 19 MH/s. After a bios mod on the memory straps and a very slight overclock (Because the card would crash with anything over 100Mhz bump) I could get about 22 MH/s on this card while my other cards such as the MSI I listed above would get 27-30 MH/s for the same power usage. The price is about the same for these models unless you find them on sale like I did. This card was $20 cheaper than the MSI I bought but now that its $279 I would stick with the $269 MSI.  ,Overall Review: It would be nice to know what brand of memory the cards are shipping with as performance is different between them right out of the box which means each card does not perform the same and as such should be noted. It would be like ordering RAM for your PC and you just select the speed say DDR4-2666 and they ship you whatever brand was in stock at the time. You could get HyperX or Gskill low latency RAM or you could get some knock off brand with timings so poor and a bin that allows it to barely run at the rated speed. Just to rap up this review I would like to note that I know its a memory lottery when buying cards but if they ever had an option to buy say $249 for the cheap memory or $259 for Mid $269 for Samsung it would be great! Kind of like buying gas at the pump. It may even allow for better stock as a miner I would not want to buy a card that takes 3 extra months of RIO but may perform the same in games (Not Overclocked).

I don't game, but do use my system for video rendering and have had difficulty handling large 4K files. Unfortunately, this card failed me. I removed old graphic card and drivers, and installed the RX570 card into MB/case without difficulty. I installed the latest drivers from MSI/AMD website and initially all seemed good. However, after about 30 minutes of web surfing, the screen began flickering and blacking out, then after a second or two, would reappear. Eventually the screen blacked out completely and would not respond except with a hard restart. Uninstalled/reinstalled drivers, restarted computer and problem again recurred after about 15-30 minutes. Next followed many days of checking several websites to be sure I had the latest driver, searching for tips and other user’s experiences and then uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, but with no luck. App showed there was no problem with temperature or voltage. I even let Windows find and install drivers, and installed only drivers without proprietary software. But, after checking sites online including AMD/MSI support sites , it seems the screen blacking out is a common problem with this brand graphics card. There are all kinds of theories as to why it is occurring from voltage issues, software issues to driver issues. Some people just live with it. I tried out the fixes that seemed most reasonable but without success. Flickering and blacking out continued.

Great graphics and frame rate. Improves fps and control on games like Skyrim and Test Drive Unlimited. Easy to register and receive free game pack.  ,"Cons: Like others who have reviewed this product, I did not receive a driver disk. After installing, I fired up the system and was greeted with a black screen, then a green screen, and back to black. I didn't do anything as I had noted that during this time the hard drive was working. After almost four minutes, my Windows 10 screen appeared and the drivers had been installed. While this is nice that Win10 wants to set things up for you, it can make you wonder if the card is good or bad. All I can say is, if you don't receive a driver disk (and you probably won't), let Windows 10 do it's thing. I'm learning that this OS has it's own way of doing things MUCH differently from all other versions. Just because, I would have liked it better if a disk had been included... That said, I really don't have any complaints.  ","Overall Review: From time to time, when I turn on my PC and monitor (I have an Acer 27"" curved), it will make a crackling, static sound and then the start up screen is in all kinds of strange colors. After rebooting, it seem to be okay. Many have relayed this to a problem with the card, but after studying the problem, as well as continuing to learn more about Windows 10, I am of the opinion that this is not a hardware problem but a glitch in Windows 10 recognition. Sometimes it sees the card and sometimes it doesn't. Let us not forget that Windows doesn't like anything that isn't certified or contains a signature. Most video card drivers contain neither because they are constantly (usually monthly) being updated. Therefore Windows 10 recognition software has a habit of ""kicking"" your video drivers while trying to install it's own generic drivers which causes a problem. One thing I have been doing for the past week and, so far, all has been well, when I turn on the PC, I wait 30 seconds to 1 minute before turning on the monitor. So far...I have not encountered the evil pale colored screen. Hope this helps others who buy this card.",2019-04-17 11:33:00

She games at 1080p and needed more power as the 950 was not offering good frame rates.  First of all, the card is a bit longer than I was anticipating, but still fit (barely) in her ITX case. It is nicely put together and comes with a backplate which is nice. There is no RGB bling or stuff like that, but the card is good looking. Under normal operation, it is silent as the fan does not spin until it hits 60C. I set up a custom fan profile, but even with more aggressive fan curves, it is still super quiet even at 60% fan.  Overclocking is easy with it, with no voltage increase and using Trixx, it still easily hit 1450mhz on the core and 2200mhz on the memory, which is a large boost in performance from the base clocks. At those speeds it is of course slower than my sons overclocked GTX 1070 (2050mhz core). But for example in the Time Spy benchmark graphics test 1, achieves 31fps vs 43fps and 26 vs 38 in test 2, Which TBH for a $150 graphics card after rebate is a pretty good showing. The only downside is that it uses almost as much power as my 1070. But realistically, even if it was an extra 50w and she gamed 40 hours a week, here in Washington that would only be $10 a year in extra energy costs.  Overall I am very happy with it's performance. It runs quiet and MSI offers a great 3 year warranty. Once you factor in the 2 free games which I would have bought anyway, which are worth $40-60 each, the card is a bargain. 5 eggs.",2018-11-25 20:24:00

See Below.  ,"Overall Review: Definitely would buy another!  The MB I have is ASUS Crosshair 8 Hero. This board has plastic guards near the PCI Slots (1&2). The guard covers the onboard sound processor I believe.  On the GPU mounting bracket, there are 2 stamped dimples in the metal mounting bracket. These dimples on the mounting bracket of the GPU hit the plastic guard on the MB and will not let the card fully seat into PCi#1. It will install in PCi#2, as the guard on the MB is molded slightly farther in at that PCI slot, but who wants to run a single card at 8X?  I looked at my 970 GTX and older cards and there is no dimples on the mounting brackets.....so must be something new with this series.??  You will have two choices. Modify the guard on the MB or modify the mounting bracket on the GPU.

I have an older z97 classified board with slower ddr3 2600 ram and a i7-4790k overclocked to 4.6ghz. A newer AMD 3900x and ddr4 4000 would pair far better. Also, I run all my games at 5760x1080, three monitor in surround.  Anyway, this card has been great. I can run all my games at max graphics without any issues. And yes, I did go through the nvidia control panel and max all the setting in there as well, except one, DSR. If you put it at 4x native resolution, it will start to chug a little. It has been fairly cool, given the room temp, and the fans keep it steady. I normally don't see anything above 60c. I do however, not care about fan noise at all. I use a headset with active noise cancellation and it drowns out all the fan white noise. I keep the fans at 100% all the time, all my fans. This might be why the temps are so low. With that noted, I also have not removed all the plastic covers from the card as I wasn't sure if the card was going to have problems. I was trying to keep it in as much of an OEM state as possible (See Overall to find out why).  I am currently using driver version 441.66 and everything it stable in windows 10 versions 1909 OS Build 18363.535.  The card is packaged very well. The box is rather large measuring a tad over 14.5"" tall and it separates in the middle making two halves.  ","Cons: It does not come with any extra accessories. If were wanting an HDMI to DVI-I or DVI-D, forget it. The only thing it comes with is the quick install guide. This isn't really a con as the pictures for the box and card clearly show this. Also, no idea why anyone says the price is a con. Come on! You know the price before you buy it. You know what your getting yourself into.  ","Overall Review: Overall I am very happy with this product. I went through two RTX cards before buying this one. The first one was an MSI 2070 super Ventus OC. The MSI would not show up as an RTX or Nvidia card at all. The installer program kept saying that it could not find a compatible card. Next, I bought an EVGA 2080ti XC Ultra, both cards were from besbuy. The xc ultra kept crashing on all my games and it was running hot, 80c+. The XC ultra is also rated very poorly on newegg, which should have given me a clue, but hey, its besbuy, they have a return policy for a reason. Anyway, I ended up with this 2080ti black edition and so far everything has worked exactly as it should. No game crashes or driver issues what so ever. I would recommend buying from newegg over besbuy for pc parts. It is nice however, being able to go to a store and immediately get your money back. But, besbuy sells the bottom of the barrel cards, even from EVGA. Stick with newegg.",2020-01-07 16:40:00

Ran the Quake 2 RTX game on my 1080 (prior to setting this one up), ran a like a slide show as you'd expect. After installing the 2080 TI I was blown away with how fast it was at 2560x1440 with the raytracing jacked up. Sure, it's a 20+ year old game, but still neat nevertheless.  I've only had 2 problems with it so far: 1. With vsync enabled in Rage 2 the game had massive random slow downs. Never had this with my 1080, but I expect that's a driver issue. Turning off vsync in the game fixed this, so not a big deal.  2. The more serious issue is that I'm seeing flickering on my 2nd monitor at the bottom of the screen. Never had this with my 1080.  I have two PB278Q 27"" monitors, my primary monitor is on HDMI. The secondary is on display port. The secondary monitor is the one with flickering on the bottom of the screen. The primary on the HDMI connection is stable and fine.  I switched cables, and I switched ports, but the behavior was the same. However, I found 2 ways to mitigate the issue: 1. Switch to 1920x1080 - That's a hard no. 2. Set up a custom resolution of 2560x1440 @ 59Hz vs the native resolution of 2560x1440 @ 60Hz. I did this through the Nvidia control panel. This works pretty well, but some games (e.g. Rage 2) reset the resolution to the native again (even in borderless mode... incredibly dumb).  I have found many reports of this issue with this specific card (not necessarily EVGA. Other manufacturers seem to have this issue too) on Nvidia's forums. So this, coupled with the workarounds above, does NOT appear to be a hardware issue, but a driver problem. So I'm hoping that Nvidia sorts this out (maybe EVGA can give them a kick in the pants?)  Beyond that, it's been great so far. And I hope this info helps others.",2019-12-18 21:35:00

1417,1299.18,evga,evga geforce rtx 2080 ti 11g p4 2281 kr,Pricey but an amazing card,5,2019-08-14 00:00:00,8/14/2019 0:01,pricey but an amazing card runs cool on load mid high 60s great for 1440p and 4k no more worries about running future triple a titles quality build easy to install no issues so far requires two 8 pin pcie connectors so if the electricity bill is a concern then this isn t the right card it s very heavy i recommend buying a gpu bracket or brace to support its weight i bought this card as an upgrade from a gtx 980ti it s a big jump in performance but the 980ti is still a really really beastly gpu even in 2019 for its performance i can t justify the price for someone gaming on 1080p 60hz there s better alternatives but if you see yourself buying a higher resolution monitor in the near future say 1440p and above this is the card that will secure stable frames in any title with the highest graphical fidelity the card does not run hot for me as stated by others who bought this aftermarket version i hover 55c on light gaming and max out at 69c on load with default fan curves it may be because i have pretty decent airflow within my case which is a corsair obsidian 750d airflow edition i ve got plenty of room inside and i have tons of fans i do see people reaching mid 70s but closer inspection in their builds does reflect their thermals due to less adequate airflow and size of the case you can always undervolt the card to get a slightly less voltage if thermals in your set up are an issue overclocking can make this card run 76c and above mine peaked at 82c before thermal throttling that s with default fan curves with an aggressive fan curve i do not get temperatures above 78c i don t go heavy on the overlocking also buy this card if you have the money and want the fastest consumer centered gpu more support for rtx is in the future and as more titles adapt it this card will play them well it will last you for many years to come ,Jacob L.,2019-08-14 00:01:00,2019,8,Pros: Runs cool on load (mid-high 60s). Great for 1440p and 4K. No more worries about running future triple A titles. Quality build. Easy to install. No issues so far  ,"Cons: Requires two 8-pin PCIe connectors. So if the electricity bill is a concern, then this isn’t the right card. It’s very heavy, I recommend buying a GPU bracket or brace to support its weight.  ","Overall Review: I bought this card as an upgrade from a GTX 980Ti. It’s a big jump in performance, but the 980Ti is still a really really beastly GPU even in 2019. For its performance I can’t justify the price for someone gaming on 1080p 60hz. There’s better alternatives. But if you see yourself buying a higher resolution monitor in the near future, say 1440p and above, this is the card that will secure stable frames in any title with the highest graphical fidelity.  The card does not run hot for me as stated by others who bought this aftermarket version. I hover 55C on light gaming and max out at 69C on load with default fan curves. It may be because I have pretty decent airflow within my case which is a Corsair Obsidian 750D Airflow Edition. I’ve got plenty of room inside and I have tons of fans. I do see people reaching mid 70s, but closer inspection in their builds does reflect their thermals due to less adequate airflow and size of the case. You can always undervolt the card to get a slightly less voltage if thermals in your set up are an issue.  Overclocking can make this card run 76C and above. Mine peaked at 82C before thermal throttling. That’s with default fan curves. With an aggressive fan curve, I do not get temperatures above 78C. I don’t go heavy on the overlocking also.  Buy this card, if you have the money and want the fastest consumer centered GPU. More support for RTX is in the future, and as more titles adapt it, this card will play them well. It will last you for many years to come.",2019-08-14 00:01:00

The 2080 Ti can run 4K/60fps/Ultra with little problem and completely destroys anything on 2K or lower. That said, if you don't have a monitor with a high display resolution and/or refresh rate, this card is massive overkill and, frankly, a waste of money. I haven't delved much into the raytracing stuff mainly because I prefer 4K with a steady frame rate over 1080p with pretty lighting. I ran a raytracing demo of a game whose name escapes me, and it looked nice, but again, the low resolution and inconsistent frame rate isn't worth it. If you're reallyinterested in raytracing I'd just wait another gen or two so the technology can catch up to the idea; raytracing is just far too demanding and too rare in modern games this early in its lifetime. But with non-raytraced games, it's a monster.  The extra power doesn't come without cost, however. Although its idle temp is ~45°C, the temperature can skyrocket to 80°C under full load, even with fans on 100% speed. I didn't have this problem with my 1080.  Had an issue with my first card in that one of the fans just died for seemingly no reason, but I contacted EVGA and they replaced it. I don't think it's a very common problem but I'd keep an eye on the temps if you decide to get this card. Just make sure to register your card on EVGA's website so if it *does* happen to you, you're covered. I paid extra for the EAR program to have my replacement card shipped to me before sending mine in so I had zero GPU downtime.  All in all, it's an excellent card for us graphics snobs that need every last pixel and frame they can get.",2019-07-09 19:39:00

Definitely a great investment if you are running anything lower than a 1080. If you have a 1080 or 1080TI, I would say not to upgrade as you are still perfectly fine for gaming/streaming in 2019.  However if you have anything lower than that, then this is for you. This card just tears through everything and produces outstanding performance.  Came very well packaged and protected.  ","Cons: The card does run a bit hot under load I noticed, especially on Apex legends. I was hitting high temps around 75-80 which scared me a bit as I never hit temps that high. I did however mess around with the new precision X1 software that controls your card but its not really that intuitive. I recommend just setting the ""Enable auto Control"" during game play and you should be fine on your temps.  Lastly, I was very very skeptical after seeing what these cards cost and I seriously considered going with the 1080 opposed to the TI as this was a $500.00 price difference. I am very glad I didn't, as I know this card will last me the next 5 years for gaming and streaming and having that extra 3 GB of memory definitely gives you a lot of leeway for the future.  Be sure you have a 144hz or 240hz Monitor as well so you can unlock the full potential of this card. I originally had a 4k monitor but it was only 60hz and when I got my 144hz monitor. The change is seriously mind blowing. You will never go back to a 60hz monitor ever again.  If you don't mind shelling out $1200.00, then this is a must for your gaming rig. You will not be disappointed.  ","Overall Review: If your serious about your gaming, and if you have already invested a large amount in your rig, then take the plunge.

I was getting about 80-90fps in total and could reach 100fps if I turned down some settings.  This gpu runs everything at max, not high with shadows on medium but maxed out everything. Resident Evil 2, full res, texture detail on max (8gb). Tomb Raider on max, all CoDs maxed out, Prey, Kingdom Come Deliverance, everything maxed out. All getting a solid 100 fps with no dips of any kind.  The gpu is amazing. If you have a 4k/ultrawide monitor at a high refresh rate, don't even look at anything below a 2080 ti. Don't walk, run. If you have enough to spend on a 4k/ultrawide monitor at about 1k, then you have enough for this gpu too. There is absolutely no coil whine with this card!  It's ""cheap""! Well, the cheapest 2080ti out there right now. But that doesn't mean its bad in anyway. It does exactly what you would expect from a gpu that is this pricey, it chews all your games up on maxed settings, at full fps and it has head room for more.  Bottom line, if you want to game at max settings, high res and refresh rate, you need a 2080ti and this one will do that just fine.  ","Cons: There are always cons with gpus but these aren't deal breakers and I don't really care about these because they are so minor.  It runs hot at 80c under full load. But this is at max so take that in mind. It's loud at full load, what card isn't? It's heavy, there is no gpu sag on any kind though. and an obvious one, it's expensive! But as stated, it's worth the money and if you can pay 1k for a monitor, you can pay 1k for a gpu!  ","Overall Review: I sold my 2070 and a monitor I no longer use for 800 euro so this was actually a cheap gpu for me in the end. Wait for black Friday or not, it's worth the money in my eyes.  The heat and noise is something I will be changing soon, EVGA has a custom aio cooler for these cards at 150 euro, they make these 2080ti's run cool and quiet. SO it's worth the investment if noise and a high temp worry you in any way.  Also, there's a review giving this card two eggs because of the high price set by the company? Get over that stuff.

So not bad for an RTX, I still count it as a con though. The previous Gaming X Ver. I had though, was a couple decibels louder. (moderate whine, noticable if in same room as comp during gaming)  -Possibly unstable. My first one of these cards (A Gaming X variant) turned out to be a bad card. Crashes, artifacts, etc, and after many many hours of testing (and full retesting of cpu, ram, psu, etc. Driver reinstall. Settings changes. You name it.) with 2 comps and other gpus, turned out the issue was the card itself was just unstable. Which was too bad.  -Possible failure and monitor damage. The second card I got (this exact variant) worked for about 2 weeks, was all great, then displayport stopped working. After testing with several cables and 2 monitors, turned out all 3 DP outputs had failed and only the 1 hdmi was still working. Also turned out it somehow ruined the DP connection on the monitor it was attached to when it failed. (that monitor no longer recognized DP but still worked fine on hdmi and dvi) Thankfully I was already replacing monitor that week, so no biggie, but could be bad for someone not that lucky.  ","Overall Review: Overall - cool, mostly quite, powerful card for its price point. Could have been a great buy (and given other reviews it was for many others, which is why I first bought it. But I got unlucky) but just didn't work out for me. The bad unstable card was one thing, stuff happens. But the second one also being bad, failing in the fashion it did, and also managing to damage the monitor when it failed?!? That's something else for a gpu. Makes the card a bit of a gamble unfortunately.  Been a MSI person myself for long time. 560ti's, then some 760s, then some 970s, then this card...... Now I've unfortunately had to refund this one as well, and have decided to give Evga a go this gpu generation.  Hopefully this card works well for all future buyers, but beware of the possible fatal flaws..... Probably low chance of em happening....

I had my doubts, but the game play is phenomenal  ","Cons: -I can't find the following information on this card: Can I use a fan splitter, buy a fan identical to the one that comes attached to the radiator, and have this card power the two fans? If I had to guess, I'd say the card can power two fans but I can't find the supplied current to that fan header. I'd like to run an inlet and exhaust fan using the single PWM signal from this card. So, not really a con, just another piece of information in the computer realm that is difficult to find.  ","Overall Review: I've used EVGA cards for the longest time and always had a good experience. This card is no different.  HOWEVER, LISTEN UP EVGA! PRECISION X1 NEEDS WORK!! I tried overclocking with precision X1 but quickly became frustrated with it, and went back to MSI afterburner. The informational text does not stay on the screen long enough when you hover over a function with the mouse. Not to mention, I found myself having to constantly check the clock speeds I assigned, because they would often revert without notice. The only videos I found on precision X1 were NOT helpful and basically EVGA employees saying ""hey, look what we made"" rather than actually teaching people how to use it.",2019-10-14 08:18:00

The other review on this did play a part in my decision to purchase this, as my setup is very similar in terms of parts.  Wow! This thing runs really cool compared to other cards I've used in the past. I upgraded from a pair of Sapphire R9 Fury's in xfire, and the difference is night and day! I was slightly skeptical of using a hybrid cooler on a GPU, as I've never tried that route before. Needless to say, I am impressed with the performance out of this card. It has been absolutely crushing all the games I've been throwing at it so far with the max I've been able to push the GPU to, temperature wise, being 46c. The previous setup consistently ran at ~79c, so this is a major improvement. It is also much quieter than other cards I've used.  ","Cons: No cons with the overall product or its performance. There were only two small issues I noticed on my particular unit, being that there were a few dents in the fin-stack on the radiator where it looks like it may have been dinged slightly during manufacturing. The damage is very minimal, and I'm not concerned about this. Not enough for an RMA, at least.  One other tiny issue I discovered during installation, was that the 4-pin PWN connector coming from the GPU itself is a little odd, not properly letting a PWM cable seat itself in the connector.. This initially resulted in the fan not working on the radiator, however, I was able to get it to function by swapping the included fan for a Noctua one. The PWM cable still does not seat fully, but it's enough of a connection for the fan to run. Not enough of an issue for an RMA, or to dock an Egg.  ","Overall Review: If you're looking for a good RTX 2080, I can recommend this one. Just make sure you have the room in your case. This card was a little larger than my previous setup, though there was still plenty of room in this NZXT H440 to still do a push/pull 360mm AIO for the CPU as well. The sleeved cables on the unit itself are also very nice, and add a pleasant aesthetic. Overall this is a solid GPU, and I can't find any faults with it. I seem to have been lucky so far, not having any issues with artifacting, etc. I will update this in a few week time after further use, or if any issues arise.",2019-03-08 03:34:00

Most games are 120-144. Some demanding new games dip to 80 FPS but those aren't first person shooter games so it does not bother me at all. This is also at Ultra settings on all games I currently play. - I currently have a 6700k @ 4.5 GHz, 16GB ram and was worried this card would be extremely bottlenecked. So far I haven't noticed it. I will continue to test games and give a 30 day return review! - QUIET. Even after running the heaven benchmark maxed out for 45 minutes it was under 55C and not loud to my ears. My last card would be very audible and would easily be over 80C. I like this because I know the card will have longevity to it!  (UPDATE) -Tried different monitoring software to see what temps are like. I ran Heaven Benchmark for over an hour after 2 hours of gaming to see how hot I could get the card. 58C was the high. That is incredible to me for a AOI. Also I haven't even optimized my fan curve yet either. I'm a noob at some of this. So I would not doubt when I reset my fans in my case for better airflow I could drop this down to below 55 !  -This card is crushing all the games I play regularly, works perfectly with my G-Sync monitor. -Also awesome that Newegg honored their software pack deal. I purchased the card the DAY BEFORE the promotion and they still hooked me up with Anthem and BFV!  That is customer service people!  ","Cons: - The software is wayyy different from MSI afterburner and the applications I am used to. So I haven't been able to overclock it to really see what it can do. - It also had a ""spool up period"" where it was gurgling at first and making some wild noises from the radiator. It went away after about 20-30 minutes. Had me worried for a quick minute!  ",Overall Review: - Would defnintely recommend if you are upgrading from a 900 series card. - If you could sell your 1080 ti for a fair price I would consider it as well due to DLSS and RTX. Granted it's not highly implemented yet but future proof is always nice. - EVGA has awesome customer service so if anything happens I am not too worried about replacements as well. -Awesome software I like how many sensors the card has so I can see what is heating up and how to adjust my system. -,2019-02-13 05:20:00

This is a no-frill cooling solution that will get the job done well. Period. There are more efficient coolers out there that may be less noisy, but you will have to ask yourself if it's worth the price premium for those models. Under reasonable loads, it's whisper quiet though.  One thing is that I've noticed a very faint coil whine whenever the cards gets on heavy loads. However, I really have to listen for it, as the fans quickly spin up and completely mask the coil whine within seconds. YMMV if you experience a coil whine as well.  As for the performance of the GPU itself : it is extremely capable!

But I had a single problem, and that was to open the PCI locking tab to remove my 1060. It was very hard to jam my finger under the card to flip the tab open.  You do need two power connector for this card.  The card worked first try and I took the opportunity to do a clean install of the latest Nvidia drivers. Not a single problem.  I'm currently playing Control from Remedy, and I would get 35-40 FPS on my 1060 with most options on high, which is not bad at all. But with this card and DLSS + all raytracing options also turned on, I get over 90 FPS, and some places around 120 DPS.  I did find that for the price the box could have included some extras. Yes, you do get Modern Warfare for free, but a voucher for one of several titles would have been great. Maybe a DP to HDMI adapter would have been a nice bonus so I wouldn't have had to buy a separate one.  Then again, your money goes into the card and that's what matters.

Sure, you might have to turn a few settings down to get 4k60, but this is finally 1080 Ti performance for $500. Regular 2070s and 2080s are just not worth it when this is so much better.  I got a very decent overclock by upping the memory clock and using the OC scanner. I sit around 1950 MHz now with great stability. Temperatures get high, up to 85 degrees in my case, but I have a SFF case (Ophion) so this card will probably do just fine with decent ventilation. The fans aren't too loud either, they peak at 75% and are definitely present, but not annoyingly loud. Again, sound would probably be better in a larger case.  The card itself is solid. The cooler is very compact but does a good job. No backplate, but that doesn't bother me at all. I honestly think some backplates actually end up holding onto too much heat.  Note of caution, a 500 W power supply was not enough for this card. I had to go up to 600 W.",2019-08-02 12:27:00

Like many, it came down deciding between the AMD RX 5600 XT or the Nvidia RTX 2060.  The biggest take away was that the RX 5600 XT was a better value IF you flashed the BIOS and had a 14 GB memory clock.  Well, this model has both. No need to flash your BIOS, this comes with the upgraded BIOS out of the box. And it has 14 GB memory, while most other models only have 12.  This model is arguably plain to look at, no LED lights, but the simplicity lends an air of sleekness to it. Also, be sure to measure the space in your case. Thankfully I did, and I barely had enough room to fit it. That said, the extra fan keeps this thing very cool. Was seeing temperatures around 58 F after playing DOOM 2016 for two hours. It runs very quiet with fans running, and don't notice any noise when the fans kick on.  To be fair, I have the standard AMD Ryzen 5 3600 stock cooler, which makes audible noise. So at the very least, it's quieter than that.   I tested with a lot of my games to see how it did, and I can run newish games (DOOM 2016, Master Chief Collection, Witcher 3, Fallout 4) at ULTRA max settings, and very new games (APEX, Resident Evil 2/3) at very high settings.  I haven't messed around with overclocking yet, so I might be able to squeeze some more out of it.  If this model is too big, and it is big, they have a 2 fan version with slightly slower clock speeds.  Would recommend if you aren't able to spend big money on high-end cards.",2020-04-24 06:57:00

Games are faster.  ,Cons: Defective Driver  ,"Overall Review: Corrupted GPU driver, and how I fixed it.  Storytime: I purchased this product knowing something was wrong with it. (Why else would somebody return a perfectly ""good/new"" RTX 2080)  When I installed the RTX 2080 from AMD's 290X 8GB Sapphire Tri, Windows 10 would not boot entirely. (The windows boot screen got stuck at the white dot looping in a circle)  After some digging, I found the issue to be a bad driver. (Now I am aware of the issue)  The only solution was to boot windows in safe mode; however, I couldn't do that directly. I had the reinstall my AMD card and enable LEGACY SAFEMODE BOOT via ADMINISTRATION COMMAND PROMPT (also known as CMD).   I reinstalled the RTX 2080 and my computer booted normally. I quickly mashed f8 + SHIFT to force my WINDOWS 10 into safemode.   I installed the drivers that i needed. And.... it works.     Yes, i tried the easiest ways possible: unplugging power from GPU, installing drivers before the card was inserted, booting safe mode via 3 hard shutdowns, booting windows from IPv4 and IPv6. -- All the ""easy"" and ""quick"" ways failed.  Note: If a CPU is not seated properly, the computer won't start. (This includes cpu cooling)  My CPU cooler was damaged upon purchase. The store clerk said it was ""like new"" and ""tested to work."" The truth was that the cooler was defective--Like the RTX 2080 GPU. Lesson learned from buying defective goods.  PRO TIP: Buy new",2020-03-05 22:44:00

Per the results on cpu.userbenchmark.com this thing performs better then 90+% of all other 1060 6g benched.  Excited to see how it does on battlefield V  The XOC overclocking software is , as noted in other reviews, basically MSI afterburner in a different skin.

Awesome card very glad i got this over a 1050 ti I was looking at, dont get me wrong the 1050ti is great i have one in a laptop but this thing can really push and with 6g your much more future proof.

I have had this card for a little over a week and I'm very impressed thus far. Very quiet and I'm able to play on the highest settings available for games that are GPU intensive. Works amazing for video editing in Premiere too, which is another reason for this purchase. The fans have never roared up and while under heavy load, I don't feel any severe increases in temperature. At $300, I was unsure, but the 0% interest for 12 months on $500 or more meant I had to get a 512GB M2 stick as well. My GTX 950 now runs OBS while this monster takes care of the games. Love it!  ","Cons: The size is a problem. While it does fit into my computer case just fine, I had to be more clever with cable management. Not only this, but the card extends clear over my board and rests against the data ports on the other side. This made it nearly impossible to clip into the motherboard. This also means I may have to pull the graphics card to attach additional hard drives. Not a big deal, but just a FYI",.,2017-12-16 16:20:00

I watch it like a Hawk. Well I had been noticing that i was getting on average 2 hardware errors per day in the index. That is 2 of the red X that about drive me nuts. A hardware error is a huge deal even when there is zero evidence that there was a problem and that is what happened to me. Here is the Deal I figured out that the EVGA Precision XOC was the culprit. You can do your own homework and you will find not a lot of kind words about this Software. EVGA doesnt have it going on with the latest version. I didnt try earlier version. The only way I was going to fix this was do a Restore from an Image I made before I even loaded Precision XOC. I varified after doing so that it was the culprit to the Hardware errors and using the Even viewer. But here is what you want to know. Do what people are say to do all over the net use the MSI Afterburner Software instead. Wow there just is not comparison to how much better it is. Just do it and you will thank me if you didnt already know about this. The Card seems to work just fine with the MSI software.  ",Overall Review: I really was quite angry that I found the Precision XOC causing me these problems and I will most likely never use it again. OH there is one other Con i wish this Card Supported SLI but it does not have a connection for SLI. I guess this is another way to get you to spend another 150 dollars at least for a 1070. This card does 60 FPS in 1080p pretty consistently. Its a good choice. EVGA makes good Cards. They need to higher the MSI software developers to make their Precision XOC software.,2017-12-12 23:26:00

It seemed that on the single-fan card it was basically luck of the draw, as many customers didn't seem to complain, and others resolved the issue with an exchange.  So I decided to spend more money on this dual-fan version of the card because it had similarly high ratings, but very little mention of coil whine. I assumed the reason for the quieter performance was because of the 4+1 supply design in the dual-fan card compared to the 3+1 design in the single-fan one. And I also assumed having two fans would allow lower fan speeds for the same amount of cooling, thus mitigating some single-fan comments about excessive fan noise when high amounts of cooling was required.  I was excited to get and install this card, but was immediately disappointed when Unigen's SuperPosition VR benchmark immediately caused it to start whining like crazy (their Heaven and Valley benchmarks caused similar -- and in some cases even higher -- whine). Since EVGA warrants against coil whine, I RMA'd it through Newegg and received a second one that, unfortunately, whined just as bad. And worse, the benchmark -- which was consistently over 9500 in repeated runs with the first card -- is consistently in the 9200 range with the second card (it's almost as if the higher clock speeds of the SSC version were not somehow engaged, and it is instead running the clock speeds of the standard versions of this card -- something I will check out later).  Were the coil whine and inconsistent performance between cards not a problem, I would likely have rated this a four-star card (one star being removed for not having 2 HDMI ports that would prevent a person from having to swap with the display when running a VR headset -- something the card is advertised to support, so two HDMI ports would have been a correspondingly nice feature that other manufacturers of this card do include). I almost removed another star because the first card was hard to install (the bracket's screw hole slots did not line up with case) while the second one went in quite easy, but given the reasonable performance of this card, one star seemed too little.  As an aside, I placed my order early in the day, but for some reason Newegg chose not to ship it out until very late the next day. That second day, the priced temporarily dropped $10 and EVGA additionally began offering a $30 mail-in rebate. Since the card didn't ship until the evening of the day the rebate went into effect, I asked Newegg if I could have the order dated for the actual day it shipped so that I could take advantage of that rebate. While they did offer a $10 Newegg gift card for the price adjustment, they would not honor the rebate. And because this card had a ""no return"" (other than RMA) policy, I could not cancel and reorder it to save some money.  So because of Newegg's no-return policy, I an now stuck with a noisy card that performs worse than the prior (also noisy) card I originally had (along with the pleasure of having had to be another week without a video card while waiting for the slower one to arrive). While I have had good luck purchasing through Newegg in the past, other sites sell these same cards and have no problems with returns. So in the future, if Newegg is not going to honor refunds on a particular product, I would recommend that people purchase it through a different site instead.",2017-11-17 11:30:00

","Cons: -If you have a Screw-less mounting solution on your case be aware that the lower mounting snap will not close due to the design of the GTX card, this is not a big deal for me but could be a game breaker for others, I just secure it with a screw to make sure it will not fall out -needs power hungry, a 500 W power supply may not cut it for you, read the minimum requirements (not a big deal for me as I run everything of an 750 W)  ","Overall Review: Make sure your Power supply has enough connections to connect this card.  The Mounting option on a tooless case is tricky and may need some tinkering  PCI-e x16 3.0 but is compatible with a PCI-e x16 2.0 (my board is still 2.0 and it runs the card fine) do your research on PCI-e x16 2.0 you will see that most PCI-e 3.0 is a gimmick right now as most cards do not even need that kind of connection speed.  I was between this card, and the Rx580, the only thing I have to say here is that the Rx580 supports Freesync and this card does not, NVidia cards do support Gsync which makes their monitors almost double as expensive as the FREESYNC counterpart. if you are into Freesync or Gsync stuff and need it then do your research fist before you purchase an GTX or NVidia card. If you have a Freesync monitor you still can install this card but would lose the feature of Freesync keep that also in mind, I did that and don't see much of a difference, but then again, taste and preference I guess.  Did I mention that the 3GB card and the 6GB card are night and day? Yes you can play most of your games on a 3GB card right now without much problems at almost the same settings as the 6GB card, but and here is why I purchased this card at 6GB, future supportability and upcoming titles, you do not need those 1070 and up if you have a 6GB for most games, yes first person shooters or competitive gaming is a different story but for most of what you game alone at home this card will not let you down... $300 well spend if you ask me",2017-09-25 10:49:00

","Cons: - No back plate, which kinda sucks because the card is big enough that it should have a back plate installed. It does have a front plate that goes the length of the card, so that helps, but I guess I'll see how it does over time if the card starts to droop down in my case.  ","Overall Review: The only reason I bought this card is to replace an RX 580 that died on me in less than a month, and with no stock on the 580's right now, I had no choice but to replace it with this card. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy with this card, but I liked the RX 580 better. As far as gaming performance, I get >10 fps more in DX11 games with this card than I did with the RX 580, but in DX12 (which is why I purchased the RX 580 in the first place), I was getting >10 fps more with the RX 580. My RX 580 was running at 1450MHz, so that's probably one reason why it out performs this card so well under DX12 gaming. Who knows. But even with the RX 580 running at 1450MHz, it still was about >10C cooler than this card. That doesn't bother me, because like I said, this is a SSC card that's meant to perform, which it does very well. I have no regrets with this purchase - this is my first EVGA card, and I gotta say, I'm very impressed with the quality and performance. If EVGA made AMD cards, I would probably purchase EVGA cards exclusively. No joke. I highly recommend this card for an ultra quality 1080p gaming experience.",2017-06-12 09:44:00

Had I known about EVGA quality then, would had purchased the brand over the one I chose & now my favorite for every component with their brand stamped on these.  There are many positives about this card, that I could write a book over, yet I'll spare all of the details & say that if one wants a decent single card upgrade for an OEM PC with a 400W PSU or larger, this is the one to get. SSC means Super SuperClocked, meaning that EVGA has done the tuning for us, while I have the EVGA Precision X app installed, haven't bothered with overclocking, use for monitoring only.  Make sure that you're getting the right card in the right box before opening, on the rear, there's serials on the box & card, if either differs, contact Newegg ASAP & ask for exchange, this is an extra on the part of EVGA to ensure we're not getting a knockoff card, or 'open box' unit with a different serial that matches what's on the box. Don't remove the outer wrapper until this check is performed.  The EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SSC (6GB GDDR5) makes my XPS 8700 run & feel like new again!",2017-05-18 11:04:00

CHECK BENCHMARKS online first. 2) The card is fast enough to play the games you like (of course). CHECK BENCHMARKS online first. 3) THE BIG ONE!! Your CPU is NOT a bottleneck** to ensure you get the graphic speed you paid for (userbenchmark.com is a great place to check). I have enjoyed playing with the different parts to optimize a new PC build, and you might like it for that reason too :) ------------------------------------------------- **My CPU is not good enough for this card, and the result is noticeable. Userbenchmark has my CPU rated at 48% and this card rated at 68% (for now). The resulting graphics I end up getting is 52%. When playing any game, there are moments when the frames drop to about 5 FPS for a few seconds then goes back to the normal 60. Probably stays at 60fps 90% of the time. I didn't know this could happen when purchasing. Now you know :) Make sure your CPU is not a bottleneck, so you can compete against the big boys online.  * This card is a pretty good fit for 1080p gaming (for most games). I have experienced this and also the benchmarks verify that. Those same benchmarks suggest this : You can play (pretty much) those same games in 2K with a similar frame rate IF you spring for the 1060 with 6GB instead of 3GB. I say ""similar frame rate"" because the frame rates seem slightly better with the 3GB/1080p combo than the 6GB/2K combo. In general.",2017-12-02 07:42:00

I decided not to deduct any eggs for the cons. Nvidia was straight forward with this card by addressing the fewer CUDA cores and VRAM and never stated it would match the full GTX 1060. Their 5% reduction in performance claim compared to its bigger brother is mostly spot on with benchmarks. This card was meant to compete with the RX 480/470 at it's price point and really packs a punch when comparing the cards. The 3GB GTX 1060 pretty much stomps the RX 470 and beats the RX 480 4GB in most titles. This card may not be as ""future proof"" with its VRAM limitations but will remain a great card for a couple more years. Vulkan allows the RX series cards to really stretch their legs and can outmatch the 1060. However, very few games (like 4, or something) are coded to work well with Vulkan on the AMD cards. It will be a while before we see this card become irrelevant. If you're looking for a powerhouse of a card to max out anything at 1080p and play well in 1440p at a low price then this is the card for you. Buy the GTX 1060 6GB version if you want do a bit more gaming at 1440p and get some better VR frame rates. Buy the RX 480 for the increased VRAM and better support for Vulkan in the future, if that's your thing.",2016-10-10 16:04:00

If you're content to stay with 1080p gaming for a while, this card rips through games like XCOM2 and MadMax at very high settings. Night and day the difference in visual clarity, speed, and overall quality of in-game graphics. I haven't run an FPS count, but this is the smoothest gaming I've played in years. And at $199, this card offers superb value.  MORE DETAILS: My AMD R9 270, which came with my computer close to two years ago, went dead, so I was in the market for a new card. The GTX 10 Series has been making a lot of press lately, but I figured there's no way I could afford a high-end card like that. But went I searched Newegg, I saw the 1060 (3GB) on offer for $199. I thought this was a mistake in pricing, actually, or that something must be lacking with the card itself.  No, the card is from a trusted vendor (EVGA), and while 3GB and a single fan may be considered conservative by high-end gamers, the card itself runs cooler than its predecessors (you can read about this in mainline reviews), which gives room for some overclocking or potentially longer card life, depending on your priorities. EVGA also offers some nice overclocking software online, if that's your focus. The card is also powered by a single 6-pin connector, which is very nice, and this EVGA version (by dispensing with the second fan) is very short (6.8 inches), which means it will fit nicely in most any case, and it's not heavy, either. Some gamers want things like a backplate or more expensive plastic housing for their cards, but I don't run with a clear case or otherwise worry too much about what my hardware looks like inside the case. But, yes, there is no backplate and the housing materials are basic, which helps to keep the cost down, no doubt.  You could spend a lot more and get the same or lower performance.  ","Cons: You'll need to be connected to the Internet to get at the drivers since no install disc is included in the package (frankly, for the price of a cheap USB these days, I think EVGA should provide the driver files on a branded USB drive). I'm not sure if having just a single fan on the card is ""con"", but so far my GPU temperatures have been high 30's / low 40's at idle, and I haven't yet seen the card hit much over 70 under load (although I'm dropping out of the game to then check the temps, so perhaps some cooling is happening in those few seconds, so that temp might be a little lower than actual, but that still is a very good range).  SLI is not offered on this card, which is too bad. I could easily have seen myself picking up another one in six months or a year to put in SLI. NVIDIA is on record saying that they did this because their market research seems to show that gamers looking at the 1060 are not ""enthusiasts"" who are willing or able to spend money for two card. I actually wonder if it isn't in fact the case the two 1060's in SLI would match the performance of a 1080 for less cost?  ","Overall Review: If you're content with 1080p gaming for the next year or two, this card seems like a sweet spot to me. If you research where we are with 2K and 4K gaming, I would say that 1080p on a GTX 10 series, even the entry-level 1060, offers incredible graphical quality at a good price. We have a ways to go for 4K gaming to become more affordable (even very good hardware still struggles at times with 4K, although some of that is no doubt due to drivers and optimization needing to catch up--and if you have the money, go for 4K!); and while you can tell the difference between 1080p and 2K visually, to my eyes these differences are relatively minor. Or let me put it this way: The differences don't seem to justify the added costs, so I'll hopefully ride out 1080p until 4K comes down much further in cost. In another year or two, if 4K still costs too much, I bet that 2K will be much more affordable by then.  Bottom line: I didn't realize how much better my 1080p gaming could be for just another $199. I'm very happy with this purchase.",2016-08-28 05:58:00

For many others, I can't recommend this card. The card runs hot, and it gets LOUD. The only reason I bought this version was simply because I love the lighting and want to keep my setup AORUS themed; my motherboard, my gpu, my cooling fan, I just love the Aorus logo and the cool fan blade lighting is something that means something to me. personally.

","Cons: - The cooling system is slightly inadequate for the increased power-target of this card. - RGB at the cost of performance: Gigabyte chose to make the middle fan largely useless so it can have 3 intersecting RGB circles. Very strange choice considering this is supposed to be their flagship card, which means it should be the best performer and best looking. You should NEVER trade performance for RGB. - It is heavy, if you have it mounted horizontally in a normal upright computer case, you need to use the kickstand - The box is too big. Its completely unnecessary and way larger than it needs to be. - The PCB has a fan header so you can't use any standard water blocks. You may be able to modify a block to fit, but it seems like an unnecessary change Gigabyte made to make sure there's a market for the ""WB"" version of this same card.  ","Overall Review: I know it seems like there's more cons than pros, and there are, but they only amount to my specific nit-picky concerns. If you plan on using this on an open bench, are okay with noise, and dont expect huge overclocks, its a decent card. Although, if that is the case, spend a little less and get a lower tier model. $1300 is what you should pay only if you're willing to throw away money or really need the best of the best.

Finally, I checked the serial to discover they had just SHIPPED THE SAME BAD CARD BACK TO ME. When I shipped it back to support at my own expense, they simply told me (a ) it's out of warranty, (b ) they don't inventory materials to repair it (which is illegal under California Lemon Laws, requiring 7 years of repair parts available) or exchange for a different GPU, and that (c ) I needed to give them more money or they would ""scrap it.""

When it was running, the frames were great, it handled 1440p happily, and I would trust the GTX 970 for an introduction to 2016-era VR. But it was unstable, and Gigabyte doesn't back their brand any longer.  I will be sharing this experience everywhere I can, and will no longer select Gigabyte parts for any of my system builds.

Only ever use one monitor at a time. -Occasional framerate stutters/hangs, may be fixed with driver updates as they come. -The LED Aorus emblem on the back of the card is super bright and distracting. -The LED lights on the fan blades are a complete waste unless you're laying on the floor staring up into the case for the purpose of ""oo"" and ""ah"" moments. I would have preferred more embellishments and lighting on the parts of the card we CAN see at all times.  ","Overall Review: I am very, very concerned that this card is going to kick the bucket since it came with a bad DP port out of the box, but I really do not want to play the lottery and return it to risk getting a card that is DOA or catches fire while playing games. The graphics performance improvements are good but not sure they are worth the cost until more games support DLSS. RayTracing is a gimmick (like Nvidia's 3D vision) and is not why I bought the card.

For most people, fan noise is a con but I use sounds from the pc as piece of diagnostic information. Sounds tell me a lot, thus I like it. Its a deeper pitch and sounds neat to me as it varies in speed. But that's my opinion, not yours. Also the way the blades of the outer 2 fans kinda interlace into the middle fans cutout section of blades is awesome.  -So about that 1770Mhz core clock. Yeah no...try more like 1890Mhz. I thought 1770 being up from the FE edition of like 15somethingmhz was crazy. Plug this in and see that its always somewhere in really high 1800's anytime I'm in a game. I've seen it at 1905mhz and 1920mhz before but 1890mhz is where it likes to be. I have not touched any settings other then RGB and the fan curve with the Aorus Engine.  -The backplate definitely seems to be a functional cooling piece. Its got thermal pads between it and what looks like where the backsides of the Vram would be. It gets hot. If you have skinny hands like me and put your hand on that backplate, you'll be removing your hand from it in a few seconds. Kinda wish it was a finned backplate but nonetheless a slight bit of air flow across the plate is all it needs. Plus it looks good.  -Wow on number of video outputs. Granted, some of them only work if you only have certain configurations of cables plug in aka, the 2 HDMI's and the 2 Display ports can only work when something isn't plugged into the other. You can either plug in 1 type c, and 3 Display Ports or 1 type c, 1 Display Port and 2 HDMI's or you can do 1 type c and 3 HDMI's if you really need that many to start with. But this gives you flexibility with your current cables.  -  ","Cons: -Cons? …not really? I mean...if your buying a card like this...you don't care about the cons. This is for the enthusiast if you ask me. If you must ask then it probably draws quite a bit power, and is probably noisy depending on your fan settings I guess.  ","Overall Review: To answer the very first review, this is the Xtreme as denoted by the X-11GC in the name of card... Seems like a structurally sound card but its still pretty heavy. I would recommend vertically mounting it just for the looks. After all the information I was looking at before I bought this, its pretty much the most powerful card there is for gaming except the MSI flagship at the time which was pretty much a dead tie. with the price the 2080 ti's, my thought was, why buy anything else when you could buy something for nearly the same price that looks waaaay better? But again, that's my opinion, not yours.",2019-01-06 15:08:00

Beats my overclocked 1070 hands down concurrently jumping from 1080p to 1440p. - Nice software for overclocking and lighting. - Nice Mystic Light effect if you have an open case. Not overly flashy. - Even though heavier and larger than my previous graphics card, the backplate and case fitment prevent it from sagging. - Quieter and cooler running than my previous graphics card. - Twin-fan cooling. A lot of higher performance cards are going to 3 fans now. I don't know how many cases have space for that.  ","Cons: - It's a bit bigger and chunkier than some other 2-fan graphics cards. But the larger fans and heatsink reduce noise and temps. - Bad MSI warranty policy for defective items out-of-the-box. Thermal tape wasn't applied correctly, possible future overheating issues.  ","Overall Review: I've had this graphics card for almost two months now and have had good luck with it, but I haven't tried overclocking it yet. I took a closer look at the card after 30 days had passed and noticed that the thermal tape applied to a row of capacitors directly under the heat sink was not covering several of them. I contacted MSI support with pictures and they admitted that the thermal tape was cut short and should be covering all the capacitors. MSI processed a return for me. After receiving the warranty/return details I was extremely disappointed, especially since the product was not assembled correctly and defective out of the box.  I have to pay for return shipping. I wouldn't receive a new card, but a refurbished one in its place. Turnaround time is 15-30 business days, not including shipping. So that's about 4-7 weeks real time. I haven't decided yet if I want to send it in, or see if it burns up and then warranty it. Luckily I still have an old graphics card.  Otherwise it's a good product. But MSI's out-of-the-box warranty policy isn't great. That's like buying a new hard drive with vibration issues, and getting a refurbished one as a replacement 4 weeks later.",2019-07-26 19:30:00

","Overall Review: The GIGABYTE RTX2080ti Gaming OC is a great card for the more professional gamers among us that strive for more performance without the RGB loophole that is so prevalent among the PC community. Compared to the likes of ASUS's offering, it is more subtle in the way that it doesn't provide as much RGB and more of a stealth ninja vibe. Don' let its appearance fool you into thinking it isn't a powerful gaming beast, as it can easily handle any triple A title at 1080p at over 144hz on ultra settings, and if you bump the resolution up to 1440p you will get around 100hz on all all triple A games on ultra, mind you all this is ray tracing turned off. Overall this card is for those who rather have as much performance per dollar, then RGB bling, and it definitely is worth picking up one if you have the cash for it.",2020-01-06 23:50:00

Even with good ventilation, I am getting about 84c when playing Borderlands 3. That is with its fans maxed as well. I got an EVGA FTW3 for my spouse, and the cooler is so much better.

It sits at a decent overclock of about 125 on the core and 800 on the memory. Artifacting is a non issue however i do notice that with almost every game when it first launched, MSI Afterburner will crash the game and the error ""your video card has been removed"" pops up. Simply turning off afterburner does the trick. Looking back i would totally buy this card again and even from gigabyte again, i get how people are frustrated when they have issues but i was an early adopter for the OG ps4 from sony and had to return that when it just bricked after 4 months. Part of the issue with adopting early tech is it will prolly go bad at some point, go into with that mentality and your never suprised!  I will update this review until a year in.  ********  I have had this card for a little over a week and have tested it's overclocking ability and also the temps. On average under heavy gaming load, the temp never gets above 65c. The power limit was increased to 123% via a bios update which was nice to see. Overall it is performing like alot of Turing cards in that your looking at a 50-100mhz OC on the base clock and a sizeable 500+ mhz on the memory. Pushing my card to the max only had the temps creep up to 70c. Overall im extremely happy with this card and i think gigabyte did a good job mostly.  ","Cons: the shroud is plastic and lacks that sort of metal feel that I enjoyed with my evga 1080ti. The OC software that gigabyte recommends is terrible, useful for fan curves only pretty much.

The card's RGB is a joke, very dull looking and only Gigabyte lights up, I expected them to be brighter. The GEFORCE RTX logo is not RGB, it's in a rather odd place underneath the power connections (as oriented in my system). 3.

Prior setup was a GTX 1080 (non-Ti). Running GTA5 with high + settings is pretty cool, though I'd have to run a second 2080 Ti to pull off Ultra I think. Overwatch FPS maxes out at 300, which isn't surprising, since I have an older gaming rig with 2 GTX 980 cards in SLI that can hit 250 FPS. Battlefield V, which came bundled, is super fun and looks great. World of Warcraft stays above 60 fps on Ultra even in raids, which is actually hard to pull off. The RGB/led lights are actually sort of cool, though my case is tucked away and they don't really matter to me. The light effect when the fans are spinning is an attractive design feature.  ","Cons: The only con so far are all the people in the reviews saying their card only lasted 30-60 days before having to go through the RMA process. Like many others, I picked the Gigabyte card after shopping for any other high end/triple-fan designs that were actually available/in stock and this was the first one to become available. Potential con is the high cost of the NVLink if I decide to get a second card.  ","Overall Review: The longevity of the card has me worried, as almost all of the negative reviews are about dead cards not at day 1, but at day, say, 10-30. So the stress or fear of the card dying at any time takes away some of the fun of having the highest end card currently available for consumer PC gaming. I run 1440p in G-sync on a 27"" Asus Predator monitor and everything is butter smooth. The processor is a Ryzen 7 2700X with a very mild overclock with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM on an EVGA 750w power supply.",2019-01-22 10:28:00

Actually only thing I am not 100% sure on so far is the Aorus Engine. Compared to Precision XOC or MSI Afterburner it seems to be just kinda meh...

If they have cards they should just make them available without attaching other products to it. It just screams ""greedy"" at customers. And another thing.. Be aware that the power limit doesn't go over 111% I've heard and read from people claiming it's only the case for the Windforce model but it's also the case for this one.  Edit: The power limit does increase to 122% with a bios update.

The card also has EVGA's step up program which is really great considering Nvidia dropped a ""2070 Super"" refresh so soon after releasing the 2070, but the program didn't work well for me  ","Cons: I say the card is ""mostly quiet"" because when you're gaming the fans don't spin loudly, but if you're not gaming the card fans spin and turn off and spin and turn off every few seconds and it makes a clicking sound each time. Really annoying.  As for the ""Step Up"" feature I feel a bit burned. Nvidia decided to release the ""Super"" lineup of cards and this upset a lot of people who already bought non super cards. As someone who used to buy cheaper graphic cards from other brands I felt really happy that I had bought an EVGA card because it meant I had the literal perfect reason for why having a ""step up"" option matters. So I look to see what step-up options I have for a 2070 super and it turns out I can only get a 3 card slot variant, which won't fit in my PC. But I know EVGA can add more cards to the step up program as time goes on so I tried waiting, but no new 2070 super cards became available that would fit in my case. So I called EVGA to see if I could step-up to a 2 card slot variant since while I would love the 3 slot FTW3 version, it literally couldn't fit in my case. I was told this wasn't possible and that I was stuck with the 3 slot FTW edition as my only upgrade. Sooo, I've agreed to the step up terms, and will pay to step up to a card that won't fit in my case....Yeah somehow I don't feel like the step up program is worth it.  ","Overall Review: EVGA's build and card quality are really amazing. The fan clicking is annoying but I've heard of people being able to fix it. Nvidia's 2070 super refresh showed us all why having EVGA's step up program is a good thing to consider when buying an Nvidia GPU, just be prepared that the step up program might not actually help you.",2019-08-24 23:05:00

","Cons: The benefits of the RTX 20xx cards are unlikely to be felt as of the time of this review - you can count the number of games using the much-hyped Ray Tracing on one hand, and for those who aren't interested in any sort of future-proofing the cost is prohibitive, which combined warrants deducting one pip. Given a bit of time and a reduction in price, this point can be dismissed.  ","Overall Review: -Had a bit of scare when I noticed the fans weren't spinning up at all when running some games; some research indicates that EVGA's cards will not activate the fans unless the card exceeds a minimum temperature threshold, and otherwise relies on passive heat dissipation. There's nothing in the product literature to indicate this - I had to apply some Google-Fu and sift through the results - and if I could make a suggestion to EVGA, it would be to spell this out in the product manual somewhere. -My own positive experiences may be somewhat misleading as my monitor doesn't support anything over 1080p, making it difficult to get a clear assessment of exactly how far I can push this GPU before experiencing slowdown. -As a recommendation to prospective buyers, refer to the one con I listed before - if you don't care about trying to future-proof your system, you might do yourself a favor and look at something like a 1080ti, to get similar performance at a better price.

The issue is so wide spread EVGA is out of stock of replacement fans. My GPU is also running hotter in idle than it should be.

They used a vendor for memory and it will look fine under furmark, etc.. But actual play on the cards reveal a host of issues. So basically if you buy the card, you're testing gigabytes cards. The good news is Gigabyte is manning up and doing the right things: RMA service is good I hear.

I knew I wanted 2 or 3 fans (probably 2 though, I didn't want a max length card for my case) and I wanted a SUPER, but beyond that I needed to find out which one had the best speeds and cooling. I came across an article that recommended this model as one of the best to pick from due to higher clock speeds. It also has 2 fans, which is a nice fit.  As far as I can tell, all RTX 2080 Supers come with Binned Chips. At least, I've read that NVidia is using those Binned Chips for all Supers. Could be wrong, not sure. I just know that I can't find ""A"" chip information for any model of 2080 Super, but I could for 1080's and others. So I don't think it matters quite as much in that regard which one you pick, but I still went with a pre-OC card just to be safe.  The actual performance and temperatures of the card have been great. It's boosted itself up over the 2000MHZ range, worked immediately, and after I put in my own custom cooling curve, the gaming temperatures have stayed steady around 76 and 77c. Not the coolest, but certainly well below problematic temperatures (90c and above). I installed additional case fans that I had ordered anyway, and put in my own custom fan curve and that dropped temps down to 65c or lower while gaming, much much better.  All in all, this is a great card. It's big and thick, but not as big or thick as a 3 fan model would be, it's powerful as heck, and it's one of the more affordable 2080 Super's as well.

I realize that is very subjective though. -The card screams high build quality. The thing is a tank, it's big and heavy. Very happy with the design and feel of the thing, rock solid as it gets!  ","Cons: -It was a bit finicky from the get go, w/ shadows being a little more blockier in games than on my 1070 Ti. Also get a weird, half the screen artifacting for a split second, then back to normal. Didn't think much of it at first. -Its been a little over three months now, and one of the display ports absolutely does not work, another is finicky, and the last one works. Also get weird flashes of green or something during a game, almost like global illumination w/ a green light for a second, then it goes on like nothing happened. Also has some stutters and frame time issues as well, and slow loading icons on my windows desktop when starting up (does not happen when I throw my old 1070 Ti FTW Ultra Silent in there). There's some weird issues with the menus and tool bars and mini maps and the like, flickering while gaming. Doesn't happen all the time, but it happens on and off, which is annoying. Again, throw my 1070 Ti in the system, same settings and everything, and it's all normal.  ","Overall Review: -Was a little skeptical buying this card, as some of the early reviews out there on Newegg were having a lot of these break down. Decided to pull the trigger anyway, as EVGA is amazing when it comes to warranty and customer service. I have been really stoked from the get go, as it is perfect for my 1440p 144Hz monitor with G-Sync, even despite it being finicky at first. Decided to give it some time before I reviewed this, and am I glad that I did. So even with a port not working, another sometimes working, and artifacting and weird green flashes, I keep getting responses from EVGA telling me to test my card in another system, to disable hardware acceleration in chrome, to check my power supply, and on and on. In the past, I've always had to tell the EVGA guys I'd mess around more before sending it in, as they'd always just tell me to RMA the thing, or at least bring it up. Seems like I'm having to do a little more work trying to get this replaced, which is kind of not what I need. The system runs great with my other card in it, no issues whatsoever, so what gives? I'm sure they'll replace it, but never thought I'd see the day I'd have to convince EVGA I need an RMA, they've always been so great about that. As far as the card goes, it was absolutely great when it was working, but 3 months and issues like this, a port out, another going out, and still it is not good enough for them to just say send it in? Anyway, just a little irking, but EVGA has never done me wrong before, so I have faith they'll turn it around, but still, must be because these cards are so darn expensive or something. I also had to trade in my 1070 Ti FTW2 awhile back, and they ended up sending me a 1070 Ti FTW Ultra Silent instead, which is a slightly cheaper model and has no iCX sensors, WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ME. After the fact they said they had no FTW2 in stock, but you'd think they'd tell me BEFORE HAND. The card is still running strong to this day though, and is a decent back up for when stuff like this happens, I just hope they don't end up sending me the non-Ultra version of this card, as the highest end models of each SKU tend to be higher binned chips, at least as far as I understand it (and you'd expect to get back the same or better model for an RMA, not a cheaper one). Will update my review (and my score) when/if this thing gets fixed. It's EVGA, though, I'm sure they'll make it right.  Update: So they finally got back to me with starting an RMA, which is great. Will update further when I get my replacement.",2019-06-19 14:01:00

Some of the issues for many reviewers, including YouTube, didn't occur until 5+ months down the road, so it became a not if, but when for them. It can work for a while, then fail/start to fail out of nowhere. Which this point could be out of the original vendors warranty (usually 1-3 months), so you'd have to go through the card maker and do a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA), which costs the customer (you) Shipping and Handling (S&H) to return the item; it costs about $30 or so w/out purchasing a box/packaging popcorn (traditional or air packs) if you didn't keep the original packaging, which most don't after 3+ months.  If you do purchase this card, then I highly recommend a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU/Graphics Card) bracket to assist w/how large and heavy this card is.

WoW, Battlefield V, BLOPS 4, Grim Dawn, etc on max settings. I realize the card is likely overkill for that resolution, but as mentioned, this was my 6 year old machine. I have to turn vertical sync on in everything to prevent tearing as my monitor is even older and only 60hz. I was upgrading from a Radeon HD 3GB 7970 card and the results give my machine new life. - Incredibly quiet, even when fans are cranked to 70%. WAY more quiet than the Radeon. - RGB is slick and purdy. Precision X1 software lets you customize the LED's, as well as the fans. - Overclock potential is there. Using Precision X1 you can easily OC the hell out of this thing. I have not done so as it's not necessary until I upgrade my monitor and build a new system. - Used the included DVI->HDMI adapter since my monitor has no HDMI/DP connections, and it recognized it and functioned properly instantly. - Fantastic packaging. - This apparently has some RGB headers on it if you want to plug in additional RGB fans and such to be controlled by Precision X1, but my machine has 0 RGB stuff in it. - Historic EVGA support & step up program & community.  ","Cons: - First con for most people would likely be the price. 9 bills is a lot to fork over for a video card, and the most I've ever spent on one. But I got 6 years out of my last card and I expect this one to last the same. You also get the great EVGA support with it. I am in the process of building a new system so buying one big part at a time. I look at video cards like monitors and even vehicles. Buy something that'll last. - This is an *enormous* card. I had to use my 2nd PCI-E slot because it would cover both of my smaller PCI-E slots that I use for my wireless card if I put it in the 1st PCI-E 16x slot. I was worried this wouldn't operate at the 3.0 spec for whatever reason, but it does and all is well. It is brushing up against some mobo connections at the bottom of my board but disasters were averted. It takes up 3 brackets on the rear of your case. Length wise, it is a few inches away from the HD bays. Check the sizes of everything if you're putting this into a regular mid-tower case. - Precision X1. This software is still in beta, so I don't expect perfection. The capability of it is definitely there to be exceptional, but in it's current state it is not great, Bob. It is not user friendly whatsoever. the program gives you no feedback as to what it's doing, or did, or anything regarding OC'ing. There's supposedly a one click OC function (the scan button) but I have no idea if the settings after it scans gets saved even using GPU-Z. The fans & LED are easy to figure out, but if it gave you more information on the overclock ability, that would be very helpful. Additionally, this program would simply not open at all in 64 bit Win7, and I had to spend a few hours scavenging the internet until I found a forum post by a guy that shared some 'Aero 2.0 net framework' plug-in that once installed, fixed the issue immediately.  ","Overall Review: It's been awhile since I did a major upgrade to my system and I was very pleased at how smooth it all went. I was concerned about it being in the 2nd PCI-E slot, about using a DVI-HDMI adapter, about poor old Win7 and new technology. The list was big, but I uninstalled the Radeon completely, took it out, put the 2080 in, display came up right away and ran the Nvidia driver package I downloaded earlier and I was all set within minutes.",2018-12-20 10:08:00

Attractive enough, has an RGB logo, which is cool (i'm honestly surprised it has any RGB at this price point) Runs cool, haven't gotten any stuttering or freezing  ","Cons: this is HUUUGGEEE. for a mid-ranged GPU it takes up a LOT of space, make sure you have the clearances. only has 1 HDMI and 3 display ports. no DVI. No mini-display port, had to get an adapter for my 2nd monitor (which is a stolen apple display) Unless your monitors have displayport you are gonna need to get adapters. I don't particularly like the nVidia Console interface. It's fine and functional, but AMD recently updated theirs and it is attractive AND functional.

I went through on MSI afterburner and tested the fan speed at which you can actually hear the buzzing/rattling of the fan and it was at 80% that you could faintly hear it. At 85% you can hear it a bit more but no way through headphones unless you're focusing on it super hard. At 90% you can really hear it if you don't game with headphones; but with headphones you can faintly hear it in the background, with nothing else playing in the headphones. Of course at 100% it is the loudest but it is most definitely bearable. Through headphones you can hear it more than 90% but it is doable.  ","Overall Review: The fan is really not that loud and people are just looking to nitpick it. To be honest, I've never even hit 100% fan curve while gaming, its always at like 70% at 70 degrees (C). So unless you just keep the fan at 100% usage 24/7 you're not going to really even notice it. This is a good deal for the 2070.

Overall I got this as a big upgrade from an RX580 and I am very happy with the transition. The ray-tracing on the card is great as well, and is a very cool thing to experience, even in a simple game like Minecraft, but it looks great with real action titles.

If the next one does the same, bad news for your rig, it's something else as I mentioned; power, case cooling or a different defective part or driver issue. Sorry about your luck! For what it's worth the system I helped a friend build is working like a champ with this EVGA RTX 2080 Black edition and an 850W Corsair RMX power supply.",2018-11-10 17:17:00

The EVGA 2080 XC Ultra has a beefy heatsink that lets accomplish both those tasks. It also supports the real time ray tracing, but of course that is only used in a couple games and really isn't a big selling point. I got the card because it was about the same speed as a 1080ti, for about the same price, but with some extra features. You lose a bit of VRAM, but since I'm at 1440P the RAM amount isn't an issue for me. If you do extensive 4K gaming, that might force you to lower texture resolution or other settings a bit.  Been playing Far Cry 5, Destiny 2, Doom, WoW, BFV, and the card has done great in all of them. I can't hear the fans spin up at all past the 30% I set as the minimum using the precision X1 software (explained a bit more below)  ","Cons: I also have the clicking fan problem. It only happens when the fans start up, so I ended up using the Precision X1 software to set a minimum fan speed of 30%. It keeps them moving but at an inaudible speed, so now I only get the clicking when I boot up the computer. I don't want to deal with the hassle of an RMA, so I will keep the card. It works great otherwise.  ","Overall Review: I really like the card, but am disappointed with my particular sample that has the clicking fan on startup. I think the design is otherwise very good, with good looks, a large heatsink, and quiet operation in all the games I've played so far. I am overall happy with the car, but wish is had been flawless. I have had several EVGA products in the past, and have always had good luck with them, but given the number of complaints about the fans in this one it seems like maybe it was a little rushed and they weren't tuned properly for startup.  I would recommend the card with the caveat that you might need to figure out how to deal with the fan noise (RMA hassle or using the software to minimize the occurrence).",2019-01-28 22:59:00

Not much point in discussing the parts that are identical on other brands using the founders card design.  When I first got this card, I was using a 1440p monitor and found that the performance was stellar. It had no issue keep 100+ fps in Destiny 2 (my favorite game). After a month though, my wife surprised me with an Asus MG28UG 4K panel and this is where this card struggles. Will talk about this more in the next section. Overall, the build quality is excellent especially with the card height cooler which was weighty, well designed and literally cooler every hot component on the card. The back plate was exquisite in designed and worlds better then the ones used on the Pascal series cards. I upgraded to this card from the 1080ti FTW3 and I hated the 2 piece back plate that was used on it. I wasn't especially fond of the clear fan housing but I did enjoy the lighting and decorative touches. I also want to give a huge compliment to EVGA giving everyone that bought an RTX card from them, a colored trim kit of their choice; all be it, limited color choices. Still though, it was a nice touch.  Another thing I want to mention was EVGA's customer service and tech support. Let's be honest here, it's the best in the business. I had numerous calls to EVGA concerning performance concerns, step-up and general information. They were always kind, courteous, and willing to give out there time to take care of your needs. Plus, they always provide custom software with very frequent updates for tinkering and monitoring the parts performance. In the case of EVGA, it is using ICX technology which is awesome and provides so many data points about the cards power, temp, and performance specifics.  I ended up electing to use the step-up program to get a 2080ti which I have both pro's and cons for. I and elated that they offer such a unique option to customers and I found that enrolling in it was a very pain free and fat process. I give many kudo's to them for offering such a great service.  ","Cons: Hitting on the main points of the card that I find displeasing.... - The card is advertised with 4K 60FPS performance in Destiny 2 which it achieves if you are standing still. Aiming down sites and renders an average 10 fps momentary loss in frame rate. Playing PVE activities, I see the FPS counter dip down as low as 41FPS when there is moderate to high activity occurring on the screen. In PVP activities, I will drop into the 30's with extreme dips into high 20's. This is main reason for the word choices in the title; performs at or below a 1080ti and over-priced for what you get. - Another negative point for me was the clear fan housing while I can see the finer points of it and appreciate them, I still find the overall appearance displeasing to the eye compared to other RTX models available. I really wish EVGA put more thought into the overall design. - As said above, I have cons about the step-up program; mainly 2. The first is the lengthy time line involved. With my step-up enrollment, I am on my 7 weeks of waiting for my reservation with no end in site thanks only to demand for these cards. I generally wish that EVGA kept separate stock for the Step-up program. This would dramatically reduce wait times. The other con is the inability to find out what your position in the cue is. Granted I understand why they limit this information. It still would be nice to be able call in and find out how many are ahead of you. Especially if budgeting for the additional funds expenditure if considering that while in the cue, these funds needed for step are basically just sitting in your account being tied up by a wait list. Beyond these two points, I have nothing but good things to say about their step-up.  ",Overall Review: Other then the lower then expected performance of this card and the higher then expected price tag. I have nothing offer that is applicable to this field.,2018-11-28 05:40:00

I am impressed with the new cooler and fans. - It runs very quiet! Big upgrade in acoustics from the older ACX 3.0 and ICX options that I messed with a while back. The default fan profile is an improvement from previous generations. - It runs cool! I use an older Cooler Master case with good airflow, 1 big 140mm Noctua fan in the front and a 80mm in the back. Top of case is vented via mesh film. Idle I am seeing temps around 38-41c....little warm but keep in mind the fans are not spinning until 55c. I ran Unigine Heaven and Valley benchmark at stock settings on 1440p res wtih extreme settings for 45 minutes each and I could not get the card to break 72c. It did very well. In games, I haven't seen it pass 62c yet.  ","Cons: - Price is a concern here. I get and understand the new RTX and DLSS technologies but I am not so sure those techs are worth an extra $150-200 over the 1080 Ti. This is where I took 1 egg off. If DLSS delivers what Nvidia is promising, then I can justify the additional cost. - Big video card! It's not long but it is thick, 2.75 slots thick. Make sure you have space beneath your primary PCI Express slot. - Uses stock PCB. For the price, I'd prefer to see a custom board personally but hey it is what it is.  ","Overall Review: I am running a 8700k at stock settings with 16gigs Corsair DDR4 3200Mhz, Asus Strix Z370 mobo. While all the benchmarks run great and some games are smooth as butter, I am noticing some choppy game play and some small stuttering in certain titles like PUBG and CS. This did not exist with my previous GTX 1080. I also noticed in Witcher 3 that while the entire environment looks amazing, Geralt seems to ghost a little bit when running around. I am thinking this is probably driver related? I know these cards are brand new so perhaps these things with resolve themselves with future driver releases?  Do not buy this video card if you are running 1080p monitors. It's a waste of money. This is a perfect fit for high hz 1440p users or for users who are using 60hz 4k monitors.  In my opinion, overall the Turing technology is promising but perhaps a little pre mature in its release. I am not a fan of the pricing but I think it would be justifiable if DLSS pans out the way its advertised. At this moment, I still think the 1080 Ti is probably the better buy but I am thinking the RTX 2080 will gain a lot of momentum with future driver releases and the implementation of DLSS in all the popular gaming titles. I feel confident that the gap will grow a lot between the 1080 Ti and the RTX 2080.  **UPDATE - 27 Nov 2018** After using this video card now for several weeks I am still a happy user. The stuttering and ghosting issues I was experiencing are no longer an issue for me after a motherboard BIOS update and staying current with new graphic driver releases by Nvidia. Everything runs great and I am a satisfied customer. Although I still feel like I paid a little to much for this video card, I am upgrading my review from a 4 star to a 5 star. I'd like to see this video card priced closer to $800. Anyways, so far so good.....good job EVGA!",2018-11-27 07:41:00

That being said, I did the same thing this time around, and the Tis were already launched. Well, that's because they're charging Titan prices for Tis now. You're paying Ti price for the entry-level today, and Ti buyers are paying Titan prices.  So I came from a entry-level 1080 to the entry-level 2080. Good boost in performance here. Visually I see it and feel it. I'm visually noticing smoother game play, less frames skipped, but monitoring the numbers, I'm not seeing much there. So I guess don't just look at the numbers.

The Hybrid cooler does a great job keeping things cool while playing games like BF5, GTA5, Division 2, etc on ULTRA. Max temperature I saw was 39c. - This thing shreds games at UTLRA settings. I have run games at both 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 with no lag, no stutter, no issues of any kind. However, on 4k, you may find you will need to tone some settings as 60 FPS wasn't always achievable. In most cases, I ran HIGH settings and mixed in some of the ULTRA settings for optimal performance. - Quiet. Even when I did turn the pump and fan up to max, it was not noticeable. - Best bang for the buck. I can save you a lot of reading, Pcgamer, Tom's Hardware, etc... for the price, you can't beat this card.  ","Cons: - Pure 4k gaming isn't going to happen at 60 FPS.

(I understand some of these games aren't the newest of titles and can run well on less powerful hardware) 4: Can easily see the Aorus logo and ""Fan Stop"" RGBs when horizontally mounted 5: I have very little GPU sag considering the length and weight of the card, I believe this to be the result of the metal backplate to help rigidity and/or my reinforced PICE slot. 6: Backplate is metal with cooling pads between the PCB and backplate itself with embossed details for a subjectively better look. 7. Has RGB if you're into that, more importantly a temperature indicator by color range which you can set with Gigabyte's RGB Fusion 2.0 software. 8: Four year warranty if you register within 30 days of purchase with proof of purchase on Aorus' website.  ","Cons: 1: You have to suffer with Gigabyte's RGB Fusion 2.0 software for any RGB customizing. The software is hot garbage unfortunately. Changing my Aorus motherboard and the 5700xt to both slowly blink the color orange, for example, will not blink in sync. 2: For some reason, the RGB LED strip closest to the 2x8 pin power connections doesn't seem to illuminate at all for me. The one closest to the PCIE pins (whatever you wanna call the part of the card that goes into the motherboard) does function as you'd expect. Both of the RGB strips are shown to illuminate in all product imagery. Might be factory defect? Might be Fusion 2.0? Might be my particular RGB setting for the card (Temperature by Color indication)? Admittedly, I don't see either of the RGB strips surrounding the fans since my card is horizontally mounted and my case doesn't support vertical mounting. Just something to point out, though. 3: Requires two 8-pin PCIE power cables so keep that in mind if your PSU doesn't have the sufficient power delivery capability. 4: First time launching my games the GPU would tend to ramp its fan speed to literally over 4,000RPM. Fast enough for me to literally feel some vibrations in my hand, though my mouse, mousepad, and the rubber feet of my case... Using AMD's Radeon software I was able to change fan speeds and would come down to roughly 2-2.2k RPMs over about 15 seconds of waiting. After two weeks now with the same games being played it hasn't done it since but even at 2,000RPM the card is pretty audible. 5: Computer was rather unstable until I finally got drivers installed - causing some crashes and even twice while literally installing the drivers. The Blue Screen of Death error message I was getting was frequently suggesting to update graphic drivers, especially if you have a new GPU. Can't install drivers for your new GPU if it crashes your system.  ","Overall Review: Overall, Gigabyte's RGB Fusion 2.0 software is hot garbage, the card may cause your system to crash until you finally get proper drivers installed from AMD's website but hasn't been a problem for me since as far as stability goes. Fans sometimes feel like doing whatever they want first few times launching a game (might have something to do with AMD Radeon Software). AMD Radeon Software is very easy to use and set up and allows plenty of tuning, mild and advanced like changing fan curves by temperature and even overlocking from the same program, streaming and recording too. The card comes with Borderlands 3 or Ghost Recon (you can pick which) which is what sold me on AMD despite originally wanting a 2060 Super for roughly the same price. Not much else to say, with 8GB of VRAM there's plenty of room for max settings on all the games I play, at 1440p-144hz and clock speeds are plenty fast, frequently operating close to max boost clock on Borderlands 3 on High/Ultra settings and Forza Horizon 4 (my most graphically intensive games) without skipping a beat.",2020-01-24 01:39:00

At first I couldn't figure out what was going on until I went into the Radeon Software to look at the tunings for the fan curve and they were comically low.  I had to manually up the fan curve way higher. Now all games run without going black... but it sounds like I have a jet engine in my case under load. Personally I have head phones on and can ignore the noise... but fair warning this thing is LOUD.  ,Overall Review: The card itself I like but Gigabyte needs to put out some drivers/or bios to try to tune this thing better. Seems like this card was rushed out the door.,2020-01-23 10:27:00

This card is above mid range and right on the bottom of 4K. It can run 4K, but some titles will need to keep settings below ultra. Medium would likely be better. There are a few issues with the software side of the drivers, but that is slowly being resolved. The drivers are good though. I have always bought Gigabyte after issues with other brands I have stayed with Gigabyte. I know that a lot of people complain about the price for what is considered a mid-range card, but people need to realize that price increase over time. Welcome to the new mid-range price. The temperature is not where most of us are used to seeing cards run, but it stays well within AMDs spec. This card is also quiet. It has a nice metal backplate, so it still looks good behind tempered glass. I had issues with some games due to software. I just shut down Adrenaline software and all was good. The new drivers and software seemed to correct a lot of the problems.  ","Cons: I honestly never find any with Gigabyte.

Great performance, runs decently cool, and has some of the best memory on the market right now.

Went from running Elite Dangerous at 85% resolution on the lowest possible settings at 90hz (barely) to running 100% on all high settings comfortably at 120hz. I am also now able to stream The Witcher 3 and other titles to my 4k tv in the living room (using it's built in Steam Link capabilities), which is awesome.

Just today my 144 Hz monitor got stuck in a global 60 Hz frame rate cap. Updated drivers, restarted computer to no avail. The Nvidia control panel was missing entirely. After digging it up through windows control panel I found that the 60 Hz refresh rate was selected in the resolution tab. After switching to 144Hz and selecting ""Apply"" the screen flashed, frame rate monitor still says I am only getting 60 Hz, asked if I wanted to keep or revert settings. I select keep and the settings went back to 60 Hz anyway. In both instances, the problem was immediately solved by unplugging DP cable from the card and re-inserting it. Not sure who is to blame here, but I'm leaning towards the card being the culprit, so this minor inconvenience is preventing me from giving 5 stars.

Within seconds of just getting to the menu page of a game I can hear all the fans in my case immediately jump to overdrive. (Devil May Cry 5, Res Evil 1& 2 remake, Shadow of the Tomb Raider) I hit alt r for the radeon specs and just sitting on the menu screen the GPU is at 99% and temps of almost 100 degrees Celsius. I checked the first one I bought with the same game and the GPU is at 99% (just on menu screen) but the temps were lower but still higher than expected for a menu screen.

","Overall Review: I bought this model because it had the highest specs out of the x5700xt line. AMD is trying to say in FAQs I've read that this is normal,,,, HELL NO,,,, I don't know if my card is faulty or they all run this dang hot. I've tried to manually turn up the fan speeds in radeon software, it helps a little. My AMD 3900x idles hot as well 39-49 C. No excuse for that. (Going to leave another review for that as well.)  The card does perform but dang, 20 minutes into a game the temperature in my whole apartment has gone up by 5 degrees. It's crazy. I don't know what these guys are thinking. It's WAY OVER VOLTED out of the box or default driver settings. It's ridiculous. I have the latest driver/software. My case has 7 fans, for my new (2nd card build). (will put full build below).  This was supposed to be a flashy seen but not heard build. But hell no that isn't the case. I didn't know that putting these two AMD items together was pretty much like buying a high end floor heater for my apt. And I can't do anything without all the fans kicking into overdrive. Even playing league of legends they start getting noisy to cool my case down. UNREAL!!!  Until this heating issue gets resolved, you might want to look at other card options (Nv****). This is just stupid crazy.  Bottom line is: AMD WTH?? We don't buy all these bad to the bone parts and all these ""fast but quiet"" fans to have them jump to max speeds for every little thing we do! Maybe playing Far Cry 5 I would expect this to happen, but not league of legends! STOP OVER VOLTING EVERYTHING! I cannot see how this insane heat helps in ANY way for the longevity of these cards!!

To start  For a lot of people the 5700xt has worked fine out of the box, but for me, I've had driver issues non-stop since I installed the card in January. From 20.2.1 to 19.12.2 I always get artifacting in R6S in the menus (not in game) unless I turn on enhanced sync. For BF4 my system will crash out and restart (no BSOD, just black monitor and then a restart). Rolling back to an October update or earlier will fix this issue only to bring up a new one: alt-tabbing will make R6S freak out. If I tab back in, I get a black screen mixed with frames from the game. For both BF4 and R6S my system will straight up crash with newer drivers. I've read many others having similar driver related issues (and I've always used the AMD driver utility to uninstall my drivers before updating). These issues are easily repeatable. I'll probably have to RMA the card (unfortunately).   With that out of the way, I'm coming from an XFX GTR-S RX580 black edition. The big base clock of 1405mhz and major stability of the card (that I used for over a year) was what lead me to buy from XFX again. This card, when it performs without hitches, is a BEAST. The numbers at 1440p can keep up or outdo a 2070 super, and can approach 2080 (non-super) performance, depending on your workload. Not only that, but I'm surprised there is no mention of the dual bios. The switch is right next to the 2 8-pin connectors (the cutout is very small) and the card has two modes: silent (which is a 200watt power target. I get 1800-1950 mhz on average) and performance (a 230watt power target, I can get around 2000mghz+). I'm glad XFX learned from their mistakes with the thicc II and came out with this beast. If I can resolve the issues, I will gladly update the rating and this review.  tldr; an amazing card for less, if you don't get unlucky by getting a randomly buggy card",2020-02-08 23:18:00

Saw an increase of about 20 fps across most of my games, runs Borderlands 3 on max at about 80-90 fps.  For those who don't believe the title and the hype, this card is absolutely MASSIVE. As in break out your tape measure and make sure you case can fit this Thicc Boy, as is this is the dummy Thicc Snake was talking about. Thankfully, I don't hear the clap of it's asscheeks as this card runs super quiet, especially compared to my old Vega 56, night and day difference, even under heavy load.  Only a few minor issues with this card so far: 1. The drivers still seem to be a bit wonky as I will have odd soft crashes and hiccups. Crashes happen during normal usage, but not during game play(knock on wood). But the hiccups will occur on occasion during game play. Not a big issue as it happens infrequently. 2. Along with the above, kept getting weird blackouts on YouTube when using the beta version of the Chrome browser. Didn't matter what screen I put it on (2x HD 24"" and a 32"" 2K) the issues would repeat itself consistently and sometimes require a reboot to fix. Switched back to stable release Chrome and works just fine. Just a heads on this for those using beta versions of Chrome. 3. This is a VERY MINOR nitpick aesthetically speaking, but the blue lights where the power connectors are clash with the red theme of my case. More an OCD nitpick than anything else, Plus, I kinda miss the red meter on the Vega 56 that indicated the load the GPU was taking.  Overall, a very nice upgrade in many aspects and a bit of future proofing as I am eyeing the sadly delayed Cyberpunk 2077 release...and Doom Eternal. Highly recommend if you have the case space for it.",2020-02-03 06:58:00

No issues with AMD Wattman. --Fans have a long ""spin-down"" time that I haven't figured out yet. They can take several minutes to spin down after being under load. --Not really a con, but take careful measurements if you have a small case. The cooler on the THICC III is MASSIVE and the card may not fit.  ","Overall Review: I bought the XFX THICC III after researching the mishaps of the THICC II and the high temperatures that plague the Navi GPUs. It does seem XFX learned a great deal, and temps for this card are solid under load. This card has revived my aging computer.  Without tinkering I received an average of 92 FPS with all settings set to ultra on Borderlands 3 (which I already owned). I increased the power limit by 10% with AMD Wattman, set the target GPU frequency to 2087, and the memory frequency to 918. I also adjusted the fan curve to something much more aggressive-- 30%@40C, 54%@62C, 100%@80C.  With these adjustments I jumped from 92FPS stock in Borderlands 3 to 99FPS on the Ultra preset @1080P. I had an average of 119FPS overclocked on the High preset. Temps under load were 65C overall with an 85C Junction.  I do not have a problem with fan noise and currently have five Delta fans in my massive Cooler Master Cosmos 1000 case with two more on the way. The THICC III fans do sound different than the other jet engines in my computer at 100%, and resemble more of a perpetual ""whooshing"" sound. My Deltas, on the other hand, sound like the deck of an aircraft carrier in the midst of counter-ISIS sorties and easily drown out the THICC III's fans.  Overall I would definitely recommend this card for blistering 1080P and 1440P gaming. Even with a mild overclock I have not seen temperatures anywhere close to the reference 5700XTs nor the reported THICC II temperatures, though I do not mind a little fan noise.

I run a 2560 x 1440 32"" Freesync monitor at 120 Hz using G-sync with great FPS. I almost exclusively play racing games (AMS, AC, ACC. Dirt 2, 3 and 4, Dirt Rally, Dirt Rally 2.0. PCARS 2, RRRE and others) and the only ones that don't stay at 120 FPS all the time are PCARS 2, Dirt Rally 2.0 and ACC with max graphics. They still play great and PCARS 2 abd Dirt Rally 2.0 are often at 120 FPS they do dip into the 80's at times. ACC seldom hits 120 on the Epic preset with max cars but still plays great even in a rain storm with FPS mostly in the 70's and 80's. I have only Quake II RTX that uses Ray-tracing. At 2560 x 1440 with max settings I get 41-43 FPS. When I lower the resolution scale to 80% I get 61-70 FPS. Just like the others that have reviewed this card mine runs at a higher boost frequency than the advertised 1800 MHz as it usually bounces between 1935 and 1950 MHz. With the fans on auto they ramp up to near 100% and my temps go to 66 degrees and stay there. I don't notice the noise of the fans while gaming but they are noticeable when I close a game and they are still spinning fast. No louder than any other card I have had with the fans at 100%.

I don't know if the disk came with anything  -I was a bit surprised at how heavy and thicc this unit was, but I wouldn't really consider that to be a con.  - The coil whine can be mitigated by wearing headphones with decent isolation, or by enabling vsync to limit the amount of resources that the card puts towards something. Not all 2080 cards get this, and some are worse than others, but in my case it's not a big deal. I hear it sometimes goes away after a while anyways.  -This card goes best with a 1440p or 4k screen.

Now, of course, it's maximum settings all the way with no worries about frame rates.  - Runs quiet! I have no complaints about fan noise plus it stays cool. If I opened the front door on my Fractal Design case, it might run a few degrees lower, but I prefer not to listen to the front-mounted dual fans from the CPU water cooler, which seem to make more noise than the dual fans on the card itself.  - Nice design and size. It's a little shorter than the tri-fan design 970 it replaced, though heavier. Feels very solid, with full backplate. After inserting into the MB and attaching the rear screws, the mounting also felt solid with no sagging. The fan side looks sleek, but that faces downward where I can't see it so who cares. Wish it had lights.  - See other thoughts for more observations.  ",Cons: I have no cons to speak of. It's only been a week but there have been no problems at the start. Can only wish they cost less.  ,"Overall Review: - I will start by disclosing that although I always shop the Egg first, in this case I purchased elsewhere. I always look to the reviews here for feedback before buying, and this great product has so few reviews that I felt like adding one. My time of use is short, but based on what I've observed so far I would heartily recommend this product.  - Here are some observations from initial use. The base system has an i7-4790K CPU in a Z97 MB with 32 GB RAM and 860W power supply. Before swapping out the 970 card, I updated to the latest Nvidia drivers and ran 3DMark Time Spy Extreme and got a score of around 3840. I then installed the new 2080 card, using the same drivers and no adjustment to the base settings, fan settings or anything, ran 3DMark again and received a score of 8998! That's quite an improvement. No doubt with minimal tweaking it will be over 9000.  - The only game I have a chance to report on is Assassin's Creed Origins at 1440p and ultra settings: MSI Afterburner was showing mostly 70-80+ fps during high activity (min 54/max 160) with 98% GPU activity, 65 degrees GPU temp, 1875 Hz core clock, 7000 Hz memory clock, and 40 % (?) fan speed.  - Now that I have this card in my windowed case, I miss the simple blue lighting from my previous card more than I thought I would. The case sits next to my desk at eye height, and the insides look dark and forlorn. However, I knew this card lacked lighting ahead of time so I can't complain about the product. I just didn't feel like paying the extra $$ to get that feature or 3 fans; these cards are a stretch as it is.  - I was a little concerned before buying a new RTX card due to what seemed to be higher than average problem rates with some particular makes/models. The MSI reviews here on Newegg sounded encouraging, and as far as my out of the box experience goes I would add my recommendation to the others. I was also slightly hesitant about this specific Ventus model, since it is a ""new"" design from MSI, only features 2 fans instead of 3, and is cheaper. Time will tell about the longer term endurance, though in the past I've never had any premature failures with cards that weren't DOA and made it through the initial use period without issues. Although the Ventus cards are priced lower than some of the other MSI 2080 cards, the cooling power, low fan noise and high performace of this factory OC chip are all winners.  -In closing, if you are looking for a RTX 2080 card with OC and don't care about extra fans and fancy lighting, this could well be the card for you! I give it 5 eggs.",2018-12-28 15:38:00

I have not manually overclocked it at all yet, although I did max out the power limit and temperature limit to prevent it from downclocking as early (standard operating procedure for me with any GPU).  -tldr^ 1980MHz boost clock out of the box  -Runs cool. Fans are not quiet, but that's a non issue for me. I play with a headset, like pretty much everyone I know, so I don't even understand the whining about fan noise to be perfectly honest. Regardless, most of the time this card does not even reach 60C under a heavy load. The highest I've ever pushed this card while stress testing it was 68C. **Note that I have used the beta version of MSI Afterburner to set a custom fan curve that is more aggressive than the stock one...because as I said, noise is a non issue. Temp is all that matters. Fans reach 100% around 60C on my custom fan curve, because that's how I want it.  -tldr^ 50-60C under heavy gaming load if you run an aggressive custom fan curve. Noisy, but who cares? I'm not reading a book, I'm playing games with headphones on. 68C max temp reached under extended stress test/burn in.  -fits great in my system. My case is smaller than your average mid tower, although I will be replacing it soon as well. There was no problem getting this card to fit, and it was an easy installation, considering GPUs are one of the easiest things to install aside from RAM or disk drives. Regardless, this card will not be too long to fit in any system sporting a standard dual fan GPU.  -Nice design. Aesthetically, the card has a sleek and visually pleasing design. It's not showy and doesn't sport LEDs or RGB, but it's still a good looking card. The backplate is very nice looking. My favorite part of the card by far.  -Has backplate, as mentioned above.  -Runs all of my games (except for the stupidly unoptimized ones) well above 60fps on ultra settings (everything cranked). Many games run above 100 fps with ultra settings and one or two compromises. Most games will run over 100 fps with almost all settings maxed. (CPU bottleneck may be in play. i7 6700k @4.6GHz. Depending on your PC's specs, you may expect better or worse results than me. These framerates are tested at 1080p, 1080p with supersampling, and 1440p).  -Potential of new RTX features that I honestly didn't even care about when I purchased this card-- I was more in it for the power. With the inflating costs and scarcity of the 1080ti, this card was the best option for the price. I do not regret the purchase. It is performing great and will likely continue to get better as newer drivers are released and I continue to upgrade other parts of my system.  ","Cons: -Fans are loud, but that's a non issue to me because I play with headphones.  -My card has a very mild, hard to notice (but it's there) coil whine when under a heavy load (only noticed during stress test when I wasn't wearing headphones). This can happen on any GPU, it's luck of the draw. It has nothing to do with this model itself, it's just the card I got.  -Pretty much nothing else, this is a great card.  ","Overall Review: -I'm still in the process of extensively testing and stress testing this card. I am not going to attempt manual overclocking until I am absolutely sure that I did not get a lemon. Although at this point I am very happy with my purchase and the card runs great-- I am aware that an unprecedented amount of Turing architecture Nvidia cards have been failing. I am on the lookout for any symptoms of failure, but I have seen none so far. Hopefully, the card I got is solid and will have many years of life in it (at least two, until I upgrade again). If this card does malfunction or fail, I will update this review if possible. So far, so good though.",2018-11-25 00:35:00

Previous card was the 1080 FTW2. Very happy with the purchase. EVGA Precision X software is still hit and miss especially with the UI. However it is a mandatory download to unlock the voltage and change the LEDs. I download the Precision X for this purpose...close it completely... then use MSI Afterburner to do the actual overclocking and tinkering.  Overclocks reasonably well. Can max out at around +150-160 at the core without artifacts popping on the screen and memory can be maxed out all the way without issue. You will run out of power limit before you can overheat the card via voltage and the core isn't stable to get to that point anyways.  I run this card stable (Using Heaven, Firestrike, and UniEngine benchmarks) with +55% at the voltage / +150 at the core / +650 at the memory. Temp never goes beyond 75-80 degrees under load despite the smaller heat sink and factory PCB. While this causes the fans to spin up a little more, it can be remedied a bit by creating your own fan curve and/or having a case with excellent thermals. At worst the fans spin up to 80% of max at 80 degrees before these temps stabilize under full load.  Buy this if you can. Better value than the 2080ti IMO unless you are strictly a 4k max, 60+ fps only, nerd. Even then, depending on the game, this card is up to the task. Probably don't buy this for anything less than 2k Resolution.",2020-01-30 10:40:00

But sure as hell this game is very well optimized and runs incredibly well with this card. I have an i5 -4690 k devil´s canyon overclocked to 4.2 ghz to complement my rig setup. GPU load gets to 99% very often, so no CPU bottlenecks here.  - RGB lighting is nice, minus the ""SUPER"" part wich seems like a cheap added sticker (this second part should be at cons).  -noticeably good build quality (well, we are speaking of EVGA)  ","Cons: - At first glance The backplate doesn´t seem to be from metal, the sound from a screwdriver from metal hitting the backplate creates a weird sound, not the usual one when you hit metal with metal... it does look a bit sturdy tought, even the paintjob for the backplate looks just not usual... the hell, my first GPU with a backplate so what do i know right?  - The TDP shows how power hungry the card is, on my first 30 minutes gaming test the card got to 81°C!!, stock fan curve BTW - @268 watts as max. output!!, beware with you power supply.  - The heatsink does not push alot hot air to the back of the case, instead, almost all goes back to the case, so if you plan to buy this card, you better get a good airflow case/fans. On my configuration, the hot air from the card goes away from the case between the back and and the last upper fan.  - Stock fan curve from precision X1 really SUCKS, temps went up to 81-82°C on my first test on my old Thermaltake mid-tower. I play on a 4k TV, so am relatively far from the chassis, meaning, i have no trouble with the overall system noise at mid or full charge, of couse i had to re-set the curves for all the new chassis fans, temps went down. It´s mid-summer here and my max temps now fluctuates around 73-76°C.......definitly a good change. Had to stick to to MSI afterburner too since presicion x1 OSD does not work, no troubles at all since that change.  ","Overall Review: First thing first, delivery and shipment were incredible fast. The newegg express eggsaver works perfectly. i made the order on tuesday by midnight, the card arrived by thursday morning (less than 2 days later), consider that i live in Chile!! The packaging was very well built, had no problems at all. I was a little skeptical about the delivery, because i was told that the card could be held on custom, but i didn´t happen in the end.  About the card itself, i come from a marvelous experience with a GTX 980 SC ACX2.0, that is still performing strong and i wanted finally to step up to 4K gaming because i had the money. I knew that i had to be on the enthusiast range, and on the red side there´s no a real support on Ray Tracing and not enough horsepower to display 4K gaming on the 60FPS range or more, at full-ultra settings , sooo i looked closely on the older brother; the RTX 2080, but then came the refresh for 2060s-2070s and this model was just announced, so i waited until i could buy it.  There are some models here on my country, but not this one, so i decided to bought it here because i feel in my case given the models vs how much they cost and my previous experience with EVGA, that this was my best bet, like some say, best bang for my buck..  What i don´t fully understand is the fact that big part of the community says or recommend that the right GPU to use on 4K is the 2080ti. This card is 17% faster than the 1080ti according to Tomshardware (which is already a good card to start on 4k gaming BTW), am just beggining my experience with this card, so go figure what may happen in the future for me, but games like Control plays really well on 4K on max settings with this card (see pros for detalis), so i expect that trend to last for a few years at least on the vast majority of games to come, including more RT features too, so i think you DONT NEED to spend 1200+ USD on a 2080 ti to see this level of performance, and That´s a fact (at least for now).  So far, am very happy with the card, as long as it has the built quality that EVGA is known for, i guess should not have a problem...

So far it is overkill for my 75hz 1080p setup, but at least I'm able to max out every game I've played so far. I've got it paired with a 1700x at 3.9ghz and 16gb of 3400 Cas 16 RAM. I haven't noticed any bottleneck problems so far. My CPU usage stays pretty low while playing games - less than 25%. I do have some games like COD BO4 rendering at 200% to push the GPU load to about 98% just to test out the thermals on the card. So far so good.  ","Cons: The ""super"" label was stamped on to the metal backplate and there is no ""super"" on the part of the card that lights up in rgb; just Geforce rtx 2080. There is also a tiny ""super"" stamp tacked on to the back side of the card by the power plugs - no big deal. I also wish that the EVGA software would allow the rainbow effect to be sped up. Right now the color shift is sloooooow. I know this can be changed via software later on.  Also, there is an issue with Precision X1 not properly saving my desired temp setting. For example, stock is 84C @ 100% power. I change it to 72C @ 100% by breaking the ""link chain"" in the settings. I hit save and apply and it works, however after a reboot it changes back to a ""connected link"" and my power setting changes to something in 70 percent power range - the temp remains at 72C. Yes of course I have all the""load when windows starts"" and ""auto load prev profile"" boxes ticked, but yet this still happens. Luckily you can adjust the fan curve and that does save and load properly after a reboot.  ","Overall Review: Frankly I wish these cards were like the FE and only displayed Geforce RTX on the side, but this is a minor gripe. At the end of the day this card works like a champ and is backed by EVGAs awesome 3 year warranty. They let you extend it to 5 years for an extra $30 which is great. I may do that since this card was so expensive. I'll update my review if I encounter any problems, but so far everything is running great after about 8 hours of intense gaming.",2019-07-28 02:51:00

The cooling is good (a bit better than the founder's edition model, from what I understand) and not especially noisy if you have a case with good ventilation. Under regular use (gaming, ultra high graphics settings at 2k resolution) the noise from the fans is easy to ignore. I've never managed to push it to 100% fan speed except if running heavy calculations with CUDA. Blocks 2.5 peripheral shields in the back, so might not be a great option for a tiny case. I have a mid ATX tower, full ATX motherboard and it's fine. The software is pretty basic. You can download it. It lets you set custom fan profiles (but the automatic setting is sufficient for me) and clock rates, and you can customize the color of the logo LED, but that's about it.",2020-01-17 10:08:00

I changed the graphics settings to 1 out of 9 and WoW still freezes once the memory clock hits 14002 MHz; occurs while flying.

Allowing me to uninstall the drivers and only then was I able to boot into windows normally. After installing older drivers from last year I was finally able to boot into windows (sometimes). Then I decided to test to see if the card had other issues. Artifacts with no OC'ing, regular crashes in any game, sometimes with errors sometimes without, and bcod a couple times. All of this happened while playing games or videos. Put my old 980TI back in and everything was back to working order.  ",Overall Review: Started an RMA and will post an update.,2019-02-21 21:41:00

It's really overkill for today's gaming. I was getting crazy FPS's but only way I knew that was to show the FPS in game. The games looked about the same as with my old Nvidia 1070 GPU.  After 4 days of fairly heavy gaming I started getting a ""Code 43"" error in device manager and the card would only boot into VGA mode with single monitor support. Zotac tech support was fairly quick (less than 24 hours) getting back to me via email and of course they wanted me to try all this stuff, never mind the card worked fine for 4 days. All the stuff I was doing led to a Win10 file error bluescreen and that led to a clean Win10 install, even restoring a drive image backup wouldn't fix it. So I had to RMA the card. My old Nvidia 1070 GPU is installed and is working fine. I now have many hours of reinstalling apps ahead of me.  I'd be cautious about ordering any 2080Ti just yet, I think they're having a lot of issues with them.

Right away, this card was a significant improvement. It has so far handled everything I've thrown at it and shows no signs of letting up. The card keeps cool enough under load, though I have not toyed around with overclocking. The only ""cons"" i can say so far are purely aesthetic and to be expected given the low price-point. I rated 5 eggs because these don't affect the performance of the card and are entirely subject to user-preference. NOTE: The box that the card came in was slightly damaged upon arrival, the plastic film on the outside had been cut and it looked like the box had been opened. This concerned me slightly, but the card was in-tact with no visible damage and has thus far performed flawlessly. Newegg has served me well over the years so I don't mind it too much, but I figured I should at least make a note of it.",2020-04-15 22:00:00

This one is pretty good. I think every card i get has some amount of coil whine, but this one is very minimal compared to the founders edition. Theres a little bit if i play witcher 3 on ultra, but its not annoying or bothersome at all. So im pretty happy with it.  Also just to clarify, this card has no backplate. And it doesnt really sag at all in my case so i dont think it matters.  Only slight issue i ran into was the fan stock settings, they seem to be a little strange. So i just set up a custom fan curve in msi afterburner and now everything is great :)  Card runs games very well just like any 2060 super would. Havent messed with any overclocking or anything so i cant give info about that. Overall id definitely reccomend this card i think its pretty solid. Also dont forget to register your evga products so you can get a 3 year warranty ! :)",2020-03-05 18:04:00

I initially had problems running the graphics card until I switched the CSM graphics option to UEFI Only. Once I was up and going everything worked as intended. I ran timespy on the latest drivers (as of May 6th, 2020) and got a graphics score of 6,067. The temperatures topped out at 61 degrees across multiple runs. I do not hear the fans at all.  Now the bad / not so great. The backplate is useless plastic which could trap heat. I didn't see any issue with this with the short time I spent with the card. I also had a hard time installing the card because it's so long. The card that use to be in this computer was a Radeon HD 6970 and it fit snug. This card is longer than that to where I had to bent the drive cage to make it fit in my case. Before you buy take measurements! The two front fans seem to be cooling the card well but the last fan seemed unnecessary and the card was not even hot. Overall it seems like overkill to have the card be so long and have the third cooling fan. I won't take an egg off since I knew what I was buying.",2020-05-06 12:48:00

Until the 4/9 driver update the card was an issue to get to run. The preprogrammed fan speeds ran the card hot. Additionally, the card was underpowered and needed to boost it by an 20+ watts.

The THICC II Pro, despite its meme name, is a very good card. It was an upgrade for me from my RX 580 and I saw immediate gains in FPS. The main downside of this card is XFX's Zero-RPM fan default. If you're paranoid about temps like me, you'll need to manually set a more aggressive fan curve. Aside from that, this card is great. Once I had it installed I left the BIOS switch in its default position to have it load the High settings which boosts the clock speed. If you don't need the boost, the left setting gives it a more restrained BIOS that runs slower but cooler. I also noticed that it's pretty well built and I had near-zero sag once it was fully secured. This card is PCIe 4.0, but it runs just fine in my 3.0x16 slot.
